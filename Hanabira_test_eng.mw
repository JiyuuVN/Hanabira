  >> <05ED> Sakura Petals Dancing in the Sun=

  <06AD> GS_CUD=
  <0784> Sunlight streaming through the gaps in the  　　curtains, I realized that the night had     　　given way to dawn.=
  <086A> This was Onee-sama's house.=
  <08F9> And this was Onee-sama's room.=
  <098B> Just when was it we finally got to sleep    　　last night?=
  <0A3A> I could only really remember up until we had　　climaxed for the fifth or so time...=
  <0B02> After that.... only losing myself in my     　　desire for Onee-sama.=
  <0BBB> Even for just a second longer, I wanted to  　　stay together with Onee-sama...=
  <0C7E> That was the only thought I had been capable　　of.=
  <0D2D> nnn.... Nanami....=
  <0DB3> Directly beside me, Onee-sama opened her    　　eyes.=
  <0E64> Onee-sama...=
  <0EE4> Onee-sama, still looking half-asleep,       　　reached her hand out to my hair.=
  <0FB0> You... you really are here, aren't you?=
  <1053> Yes... I'm right here, at your side, Onee-  　　sama.=
  <1104> Ah, I guess we'd better get up soon.=
  <119C> Getting out of bed, Onee-sama stretched her 　　body.=
  <1245> Onee-sama's pure white skin shined, bathed  　　in the morning sun.=
  <1350> GS_CLR=
  <13E5> Good morning to you, Onee-sama.=
  <1503> GS_CLR=
  <15A1> Good morning, Nanami.=
  <162A> Onee-sama replied with a smiling face.=
  <174F> GS_CLR=
  <17ED> Haa... as I figured, we might have gotten a 　　little too carried away last night...=
  <18B6> Onee-sama let out a sigh as she surveyed the　　terrible spectacle on top of the bed.=
  <197F> The sheets were in utter disarray, sopping  　　wet with sweat and other things.=
  <1ACE> GS_CLR=
  <1B6C> Aauu...=
  <1BE7> On seeing that scene in the light of day, I 　　felt my stomach twist about in              　　embarrassment.=
  <1D54> GS_CLR=
  <1DF2> Well, I guess we'll just have to launder the　　sheets and air the room out, won't we.=
  <1F47> GS_CLR=
  <1FE5> But before that, how about a bath? We were  　　really sweating last night, after all.=
  <213A> GS_CLR=
  <21D8> Ah, yes, we were, weren't we.=
  <2269> I felt a little bitter at Onee-sama's       　　composure.=
  <2317> How could she talk so calmly like that,     　　while yet here I was turning bright red with　　embarrassment!?=
  <24E4> GS_EN_NS=
  <256D> Hmmhmmhmm...♪=
  <25EF> Onee-sama's cheerful humming resounded.=
  <268A> As I started to dry my hair after getting   　　out of the bath, Onee-sama suddenly--=
  <275B> Let me do that for you!=
  <27E6> And so, she began coming my hair out for me.=
  <288E> You know... I love your hair, Nanami.=
  <292F> Eh?=
  <29AE> Straight and easy to manage, and it gives   　　off a reddish glow when you hold it up in   　　the daylight.=
  <2A97> It suits you perfectly, Nanami.=
  <2B32> B-but, Onee-sama, what about your hair? It's　　always so silky and pretty...=
  <2BFB> Well, yes, I'm certainly pleased with my own　　hair too, you know.=
  <2CBA> But that wasn't what I was talking about.   　　It's you and how well your hair suits you   　　that I love.=
  <2D9A> As she spoke, Onee-sama continued to brush  　　my hair.=
  <2E46> Time passed slowly as the brush moved back  　　and forth, one stroke after another.=
  <2F16> Aah...=
  <2F90> A little ticklish perhaps... but still a    　　comforting feeling.=
  <3047> A pleasant chill ran through me as Onee-sama　　brushed.=
  <30F3> It was like I could feel the brush going    　　back and forth along each and every hair.=
  <31C8> Onee-sama... I'm just so terribly happy...=
  <326E> ...Hearing you say that makes me feel happy 　　too, Nanami.=
  <331E> It felt like it could last for an eternity, 　　this comfortable time.=
  <33D8> But, there was no such thing as an eternity.=
  <3478> In just a short while, we would be leaving  　　and walking to school.=
  <3532> And with that, this overwhelmingly happy    　　time would come to an end.=
  <35F8> ............=
  <3678> I didn't want that.=
  <36FF> I wanted to stay like this, with Onee-      　　sama...=
  <37B2> Again... sometime perhaps?=
  <3848> Eh...?=
  <38CA> I'd like to be able to feel your hair like  　　this again.=
  <3981> Of course. Anytime you like to, Onee-sama.=
  <3A27> Thank you... Nanami.=
  <3B9A> GS_CUD=
  <3C72> GS_CLR=
  <3D07> Alright, all done.=
  <3D8D> Finishing tying up my breast ribbon, Onee-  　　sama takes a step back, a satisfied smile on　　her face.=
  <3E72> And just as I thought, that hairstyle really　　does suit you best.=
  <3FB4> GS_CLR=
  <4052> Eeheehee...=
  <40D1> My hair, brushed even more thoroughly than  　　usual, was tied up into twintails by a      　　couple of pretty ribbons.=
  <4249> GS_CLR=
  <42E7> Well, shall we be off then?=
  <4376> Suddenly, Onee-sama reached out her right   　　hand to me.=
  <4425> I, after only a moment's hesitation,        　　accepted her offered hand.=
  <456E> GS_CLR=
  <460C> ....Yes.=
  <46C2> GS_CUD=
  <479A> GS_CLR=
  <482F> ............=
  <493A> GS_CLR=
  <49D8> ............=
  <4A58> Since leaving Onee-sama's house, we had     　　walked along in silence.=
  <4B14> We had come a long way in a short time.=
  <4BAF> But now, we were connected only by our      　　burning-hot palms.=
  <4CF0> GS_CLR=
  <4D8E> ............=
  <4E0E> For some reason, I was feeling horribly     　　lonely.=
  <4EB9> I wanted to forget about school, and go off 　　somewhere with Onee-sama, just as we were.=
  <4F87> Would it be alright if I just ran off,      　　pulling this hand along with me?=
  <504B> And if I did...=
  <5159> GS_CLR=
  <51F7> Last night was wonderful.=
  <530F> GS_CLR=
  <53AD> Eh...?=
  <542F> To have been able to spend the whole night  　　together with you, Nanami, made me feel     　　incredibly happy.=
  <559F> GS_CLR=
  <563D> Onee-sama...=
  <56BD> I wanted to stay together with Onee-sama    　　longer.=
  <5768> But, that wasn't possible.=
  <57F6> That, I fully understood.=
  <590E> GS_CLR=
  <59AC> Nanami... would you come spend the night    　　again, please?=
  <5AE9> GS_CLR=
  <5B87> Yes, Onee-sama...=
  <5C0C> I bowed my head repeatedly in agreement.=
  <5CFC> GS_CLR=
  <5D91> Nanami...=
  <5E62> GS_CLR=
  <5EF7> Onee-sama...=
  <60F7> Someday, the time to say farewell may come.=
  <6196> If that's tomorrow or ten years from now, I 　　don't know.=
  <6245> So, for this moment that we had now, we     　　exchanged a kiss.=
  <62FA> We kissed, as sakura petals danced about us 　　in the sun.=
  <63A9> Our hands never parting.=
  <6435> Just so to experience Onee-sama's touch all 　　the more...=
