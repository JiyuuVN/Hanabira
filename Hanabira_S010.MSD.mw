  >> <088D> To Onee-sama's Room=

  <0958> GS_CUD=
  <09DC> Before homeroom, my classmates were coming  　　and going around the classroom in a flurry.=
  <0AAB> In just a few minutes, the heartless opening　　bell would resound.=
  <0B62> At which point, even the girls engrossed in 　　gossiping will return to their seats, and   　　desperately copy homework assignments,      　　stricken with despair.=
  <0C7C> The same sort of morning scenery you see in 　　classrooms everywhere.=
  <0D36> The quiet reserved dignity of proper young  　　ladies... was nowhere to be found.=
  <0DFC> However...=
  <0ECE> GS_CLR=
  <0F63> Haaa... aaah...=
  <0FE6> I had been sighing like this all morning...=
  <10D9> GS_CLR=
  <116E> Eheh... ehehehehe....=
  <11F7> As well as giggling strangely.=
  <12DD> GS_CLR=
  <1372> Aaah!? What am I going to do?!=
  <1404> I was giving off the impression of somebody 　　doing some kind of one-man circus act.=
  <14CE> No, not the kind of girl you'd see in       　　classrooms anywhere, I suspect.=
  <1599> Pleasant day to you, Nanami-san.=
  <1681> GS_CLR=
  <1716> Haa... still, I wonder if I should have     　　brought a gift or something...=
  <17E0> Nanami-san?=
  <1867> It's a really big deal to be invited to a   　　elegant home like Onee-sama's... I'm really 　　going to have to be mindful of the proper   　　etiquette...=
  <197F> Nanami-san, are you able to hear me?=
  <1A6B> GS_CLR=
  <1B00> Eh?=
  <1B7F> Nanami-san, were you not able to hear me?=
  <1C70> GS_CLR=
  <1D05> Ah... um, had you been calling out to me?=
  <1DAA> Yes, for some time...=
  <1E87> GS_CLR=
  <1F1C> Aha, ahahahaha... Pardon me.=
  <1FB4> It is alright, but... what on earth is going　　on?=
  <20AF> GS_CLR=
  <2144> Eh....?=
  <21C7> You've been absent-minded like this all     　　morning.=
  <22C7> GS_CLR=
  <235C> Aauh...=
  <23D7> Good grief...=
  <2458> Looks like my mind had wandered off into one　　of my 'trips' again.=
  <2518> Nanami-san, you've been like this since the 　　moment you stepped through the school gate.=
  <25EF> Oh my... could there be something bothering 　　you?=
  <26EB> GS_CLR=
  <2780> No, no, it's nothing like that...=
  <2815> Of course, the situation wasn't something I 　　could talk to them about...=
  <28D4> Saying anything would cause an uproar, no   　　doubt.=
  <2986> That's good then, however...=
  <2A1E> If there are any problems, please don't     　　hesitate to discuss them, alright?=
  <2AEC> Y-yeah, thanks...=
  <2BB4> Ah, it's that time already.=
  <2C4B> Sensei is on her way...=
  <2CD6> In a rush, everyone returned to their seats.=
  <2DCA> GS_CLR=
  <2E5F> Haa...=
  <2ED9> I was feeling a little flustered.=
  <2FC2> GS_CLR=
  <3057> It's hopeless... Why does it always have to 　　show on my face like that?=
  <3115> One of my bad habits - my thoughts always   　　seemed to be written across my face.=
  <31DD> Not to mention the other dozen or so bad    　　habits of mine, incidentally.=
  <32F2> GS_CLR=
  <3387> But, I can't help it - today is...=
  <341D> That's right, today was the day...=
  <34B3> Today, for the first time, I was going to   　　spend the night at Onee-sama's house.=
  <35D0> GS_CLR=
  <3665> Onee-sama's house...=
  <36ED> So far, I had yet to so much as step foot   　　inside.=
  <3798> Onee-sama's family operated a big group of  　　hospitals across the country.=
  <3859> Not exactly the kind of place common folk   　　like me got to intrude upon very often.=
  <3924> There was only the one time that I had      　　passed by Onee-sama's house.=
  <3A38> GS_CLR=
  <3ACD> It turned out to be smaller than I expected.=
  <3B6D> If I remember correctly, she said that that 　　had been her mother's plan.=
  <3C2C> Onee-sama herself said something about being　　spacious only meant that there was more to  　　clean.=
  <3D06> That said, it still looked enough like a    　　huge mansion to the likes of me...=
  <3E20> GS_CLR=
  <3EB5> Um, wait a moment... Why do I feel like I'm 　　forgetting something...?=
  <3F79> I'm afraid I wouldn't know anything about   　　that.=
  <4076> GS_CLR=
  <410B> Eh...?=
  <4185> I suddenly became aware that our homeroom   　　teacher was standing right in front of me.=
  <425B> Oda Nanami-san. In case you hadn't realized,　　homeroom started quite some time ago.=
  <4378> GS_CLR=
  <440D> Y-yes, sorry about that....=
  <449C> The classroom filled with the sound of      　　stifled laughter.=
  <4551> Haaa... how embarrassing...=
  <45E8> And so, who would be on day duty today then?=
  <46DC> GS_CLR=
  <4771> That... would be me.=
  <47F9> The finishing touch to my humiliation...=
  <4980> GS_CUD=
  <4A0C> Take these handouts and distribute them to  　　everyone in class, please.=
  <4B1E> GS_CLR=
  <4BB3> Yes ma'am, understood.=
  <4C45> After that - is there anything troubling you　　that you'd like to discuss with someone,    　　perhaps?=
  <4D75> GS_CLR=
  <4E0A> Ah, no... nothing like that, it really isn't　　a big deal...=
  <4EC3> Very well, that is is good to hear then.=
  <4F67> I-I'm sorry - I will try to stay more       　　focused after this.=
  <50AD> GS_CLR=
  <5142> If you'll excuse me then...=
  <5246> GS_CUD=
  <531E> GS_CLR=
  <53B3> Haaa...=
  <542E> Even for me, that was pretty stupid.=
  <54C6> I really do need to be careful not to get so　　carried away with myself...=
  <558D> If Onee-sama ever saw me like this...=
  <56B1> GS_CLR=
  <574F> If I saw you how?=
  <585F> GS_CLR=
  <58FD> Uuyaa!?=
  <5978> I jumped back in shock as I realized Onee-  　　sama was in the hall right next to me.=
  <5A4A> O-onee-sama!? How long have you been here?!=
  <5AF1> I just happened to be passing by when I     　　noticed Nanami standing in front of the     　　staff room grumbling to herself...=
  <5C72> GS_CLR=
  <5D10> Aauu...=
  <5D8B> She saw me...=
  <5E97> GS_CLR=
  <5F35> So, did something happen?=
  <5FCA> N-no...=
  <6045> Other than going into a daze in the middle  　　of homeroom, and getting reproached by the  　　instructor, that is...=
  <612F> But there wasn't any way I could bring up   　　things like that.=
  <626F> GS_CLR=
  <630D> Well, it's just that I'm on day duty today. 　　But what about yourself, Onee-sama?=
  <645F> GS_CLR=
  <64FD> I had to meet with someone regarding a      　　committee matter.=
  <65BA> And then whom did I see outside the staff   　　room but Nanami...=
  <6670> Aaah, Onee-sama is looking at me strangely  　　again...=
  <67A7> GS_CLR=
  <6845> That aside, what happened to you being      　　uncomfortable using "Onee-sama" while on    　　campus?=
  <69AB> GS_CLR=
  <6A49> Ah, that was the case, wasn't it, Onee-sa...　　ah, Yuuna-senpai...=
  <6B8B> GS_CLR=
  <6C29> Aah, just an accident then...=
  <6CBA> For now, to keep our relationship secret, we　　still address each other on campus as we did　　before - around other people, at least.=
  <6DB5> Lately however, I've been letting "Onee-    　　sama" slip out by mistake.=
  <6E73> I really do need to focus more.=
  <6F91> GS_CLR=
  <702F> So then, Nanami-san. Were you able to obtain　　the approval of your parents?=
  <717B> GS_CLR=
  <7219> I most certainly did.=
  <732D> GS_CLR=
  <73CB> When I asked about spending the night at One　　- pardon me - Yuuna-senpai's home, approval 　　was given immediately.=
  <7540> GS_CLR=
  <75DE> Ahh, wonderful.=
  <7661> The tension visibly drained from Onee-sama  　　as she breathed a sigh of relief.=
  <77B1> GS_CLR=
  <784F> Well then, I'll see you again after class.=
  <78F5> Yes!=
  <7A1E> And so, the longest day of my life finally  　　came to an end...=
  <7B1B> GS_CUD=
  <7C0B> GS_CLR=
  <7CA0> Heehee.... heeheeheehee♪=
  <7DB8> GS_CLR=
  <7E56> Nanami, you've been giggling the whole way.=
  <7EFD> Well, of course, Onee-sama invited me to    　　come visit at her house!=
  <7FC1> I feel so happy - I wasn't able to keep my  　　mind on class today at all...=
  <810D> GS_CLR=
  <81AB> Heehee... Nanami, you're such a hopeless    　　little girl...=
  <825D> Saying that, Onee smiled warmly at me.=
  <82F7> Before I realized it, we had traveled the   　　distance from St. Michael's, and Onee-sama's　　house was right before us.=
  <83E5> Anyone the likes of me would feel envious.=
  <8483> Any way you looked at it, a person would be 　　able to sleep until the last minute.=
  <854B> Onee-sama had said that while her home might　　have been close by, it was still            　　inconvenient in it's own way.=
  <86C7> GS_CLR=
  <8765> Well, we're here.=
  <87EA> Onee-sama came to a stop.=
  <8877> There, an elegant gate stood, looming before　　us.=
  <8958> GS_CUD=
  <8A30> GS_CLR=
  <8AC5> Whooooooah...=
  <8B46> Upon seeing Onee-sama's room for the first  　　time, I could not help but to raise my      　　voice.=
  <8CAB> GS_CLR=
  <8D49> Come inside for now, would you please?=
  <8E6E> GS_CLR=
  <8F0C> Ah-alright...=
  <8F8D> Aaa.... this was Onee-sama's room.=
  <9023> It was much simpler than I had expected, but　　I still couldn't help compare it to my own  　　room.=
  <90FC> The bed was a bit bigger, and looked soft   　　enough that I felt an urge to throw myself  　　onto it.=
  <9263> GS_CLR=
  <9301> Sorry, I realize it's not that interesting a　　room, is it?=
  <94D9> GS_CLR=
  <9577> What are you talking about!? This is my     　　Onee-sama's room! This is incredible!=
  <9648> Y-you think so...?=
  <9759> GS_CLR=
  <97F7> Yes! I feel like I could live a long happy  　　life just from being here!=
  <9940> GS_CLR=
  <99DE> I don't quite understand what you mean, but 　　I'm happy you're pleased.=
  <9B26> GS_CLR=
  <9BC4> I am!=
  <9CFB> GS_CLR=
  <9D99> It is fairly simple, yes.=
  <9E2E> I don't keep much stuff out... I'd just     　　knock it over and break it, you see.=
  <9EFE> Ahh, understood.=
  <9F82> Yes, Onee-sama can be pretty clumsy.=
  <A01A> A flower vase or potted plant would be lucky　　to last a week before getting knocked over.=
  <A174> GS_CLR=
  <A212> I'll go get us something to drink, if you   　　don't mind waiting a bit.=
  <A2D7> Ah, alright.=
  <A3EC> GS_CLR=
  <A4D5> I found myself left alone in Onee-sama's    　　room.=
  <A5D2> GS_CLR=
  <A667> Haaa....=
  <A6E3> I let out an unconscious sigh.=
  <A775> Onee-sama's private life, which I had long  　　yearned to know more about, was now laid out　　before my eyes!=
  <A858> The urge to peek around a little bit was    　　almost irresistible...=
  <A91A> Just a little bit should be ok, right...=
  <A9B6> Reference books and novels mixed together. A　　row of books on philosophy and medicine.=
  <AA82> And in the middle of that, a collection of  　　children's picture books.=
  <AB93> GS_CLR=
  <AC28> Ooh, so Onee-sama reads children's books, it　　seems.=
  <ACD2> I had a feeling that this was the 'real'    　　Onee-sama I was looking at now.=
  <ADE9> GS_CLR=
  <AE7E> Ah, here's some manga.=
  <AF08> So, Onee-sama reads manga as well, I see.=
  <AFA5> That was a little unexpected.=
  <B08A> GS_CLR=
  <B11F> What kinds does she read, I wonder...?=
- <B1C1> "Understanding the Holocaust"=
- <B25A> "Hell Sumo"=
- <B2E1> "Demonic Figurine Remodeling Guidebook"=
  <B3D0> GS_CLR=
  <B465> ............=
  <B4E5> Um... I didn't see that...=
  <B5C7> GS_CLR=
  <B65C> Ah, DVDs! Let's see what kind of movies     　　Onee-sama watches...=
- <B71C> "Wicked Wives - Hiroshima Resistance        　　Compilation"=
- <B7D4> "Visions of Chupacabra"=
- <B867> "Everything You Wanted To Know About        　　Aircraft Emergency Ejection Systems (But    　　Were Afraid To Ask)"=
  <B9A3> GS_CLR=
  <BA38> ………………=
  <BB0C> GS_CLR=
  <BBA1> I guess this is what they mean by that      　　there's no accounting for tastes!=
  <BC66> I might see Onee-sama in a different light  　　come tomorrow...=
  <BD6E> GS_CLR=
  <BE03> At any rate, what's taking Onee-sama so     　　long...?=
  <BEAF> It felt like a fair amount of time had      　　passed since I had started peeking around.=
  <BF85> I hope everything's alright...=
  <C017> I had been left to my own devices, it       　　seemed.=
  <C0C2> I looked about the inside of the room once  　　again.=
  <C1C0> GS_CLR=
  <C255> Today, all night long, in this room,        　　together with Onee-sama...=
  <C367> GS_CLR=
  <C3FC> Ho-holy crap... My heart is racing like     　　crazy...=
  <C4B0> If you think about it, this really is a case　　of a first visit to a lover's room...=
  <C579> Like something out of a story of making love　　for the first time.=
  <C684> GS_CLR=
  <C719> Er, what the heck am I thinking!=
  <C801> GS_CLR=
  <C896> In the first place, it's not exactly as if  　　we've never made love before...=
  <C961> Wait, wait, that's not the point...=
  <C9F8> *fidget* *fidget*=
  <CAD1> GS_CLR=
  <CB66> Um... So, Onee-sama, wh-what kinds of       　　clothes do you have, I wonder...=
  <CC7E> GS_CLR=
  <CD13> It won't hurt to peek around just a little  　　bit more...=
  <CDC2> Aaah, forgive me, Onee-sama...=
  <CE54> I found myself peeking into the closet...=
  <CEF1> But, but - this was all Onee-sama's own     　　fault. She's the one who left me here by    　　myself like this.=
  <D02A> GS_CLR=
  <D0BF> So with that said, let's have a look then...=
  <D15F> With that self-centered excuse, I pulled    　　open the closet door.=
  <D26C> GS_CLR=
  <D301> Whaa... nothing but cute...=
  <D390> Frilly lace skirt, flower-pattern dress, a  　　blouse with huge ribbons...=
  <D44F> Whichever way you looked at it, the closet  　　was full of little-girl-style clothes.=
  <D519> Not exactly the taste in clothes one would  　　expect from the always-mature Onee-sama.=
  <D5ED> Uwa, gothic-lolita...=
  <D676> One item after another of shockingly        　　Western-style clothes appeared.=
  <D78D> GS_CLR=
  <D822> Hmm, how about this drawer over here...?=
  <D8BE> The drawer was completely filled with       　　underwear.=
  <D9C0> GS_CLR=
  <DA55> Hyaa!? Onee-sama's underwear...=
  <DAE8> Each and every item was expensive-looking   　　silk adorned with fine lacework.=
  <DC00> GS_CLR=
  <DC95> Whooa?!  Wh-what's this...=
  <DD23> T-this was a major find!=
  <DDAF> Black! Black underwear!=
  <DE3A> There was cloth - barely - over the         　　important parts, but the rest of it was     　　complete lace.=
  <DF1C> In other words, it was see-through.=
  <E007> GS_CLR=
  <E09C> Onee-sama... in this....=
  <E128> Uh oh...=
  <E1A4> The mere thought was enough to give me a    　　nosebleed...=
  <E2A8> GS_CLR=
  <E33D> Oho... ohohoho....=
  <E3C3> I'm really sorry about this, Onee-sama...=
  <E460> But it was too late for Nanami to stop now.=
  <E4FF> No, there wasn't any way I would have been  　　able to stop myself at all!=
  <E5BE> I slowly stood up and made my way over to   　　the bed on unsteady feet.=
  <E6CF> GS_CLR=
  <E764> In this bed, Onee-sama...=
  <E7F1> Honestly, I had been saving this until the  　　end.=
  <E899> From the moment I entered the room, I could 　　detect Onee-sama's scent...=
  <E958> And the closer I got to the bed, the        　　stronger it became...=
  <EA19> It's definitely coming from the bed...=
  <EAB3> I flopped myself down onto the bed.=
  <EB52> Aaah, it smells like Onee-sama...=
  <EBEF> Onee-sama, right here, every night... aaah, 　　her pillow... so fluffy, and smells so      　　nice...=
  <ECCA> Clutching the pillow to my chest, I rolled  　　about freely on the bed.=
  <ED86> Anyone watching from the start would have   　　suddenly seen a completely different person.=
  <EE56> But who cares!!=
  <EF2D> GS_CLR=
  <EFC2> For the rest of my life, I will not regret  　　this for a moment!=
  <F080> Haaayaa...  Onee-samaaaa!=
  <F161> GS_CLR=
  <F1F6> Uhm... yes...=
  <F277> I suddenly looked up to see Onee-sama       　　standing in the doorway.=
  <F3BE> GS_CLR=
  <F45C> ..............=
  <F4E6> ..............=
  <F5F3> GS_CLR=
  <F691> Y-you were watching...?=
  <F7A7> GS_CLR=
  <F845> I saw...=
  <F8C9> F-for how long?=
  <F9D7> GS_CLR=
  <FA75> Let me see... ever since you had been       　　searching through my underwear...=
  <FB42> So, you saw pretty much all of it then...=
  <FC6A> GS_CLR=
  <FD08> Yeah...=
  <FD83> ..................=
  <FE09> ............=
  <FE89> ......=
  <FF8E> GS_CLR=
  <1002C> Hiiiiiyaaaaa!?!?=
  <100B0> She was watching! She saw all of it!=
  <101D3> GS_CLR=
  <10271> H-hey! C-calm down, Nanami!=
  <1038B> GS_CLR=
  <10429> It's too late! To be seen doing that kind of　　thing!? I'm so humiliated I can't live      　　anymore! I want to die! I'm going to die!=
  <1052E> Kyaa!! Don't do anything too hasty!=
  <106B0> GS_CUD=
  <10788> GS_CLR=
  <1081D> S-sorry for causing so much trouble.=
  <108B5> Having finally calmed down, I bowed my head 　　deeply in apology.=
  <109F6> GS_CLR=
  <10A94> It's alright, don't worry about it.=
  <10B2B> Onee-sama smiled gently while reassuring me.=
  <10BCB> But even still, I wanted to bury myself in a　　hole. And then have it filled over with     　　concrete.=
  <10CB0> I'm such an idiot... to come visit Onee-    　　sama's home and then act disgracefully like 　　that...=
  <10E16> GS_CLR=
  <10EB4> Come on, it wasn't as bad as all that...=
  <10F58> Maybe not to you, but what must the rest of 　　your family think after hearing a big uproar　　like that...?!=
  <110C5> GS_CLR=
  <11163> Ah, there's no need to worry about that.=
  <1128A> GS_CLR=
  <11328> Eh?=
  <1142A> GS_CLR=
  <114C8> You see, it's only me home today.=
  <1155D> It's... only her?=
  <1166D> GS_CLR=
  <1170B> Wait, so you're telling me...=
  <11827> GS_CLR=
  <118C5> Tonight, it will just be the two of us♪=
  <119EC> GS_CLR=
  <11A8A> Just the two of us... alone with Onee-      　　sama...=
  <11B35> At a lover's home, both parents away, alone 　　together...=
  <11BE4> Various phrases ran around inside my head,  　　stirring up a number of chemical reactions.=
  <11CB3> Before long, a single conclusion was        　　reached....=
  <11DED> GS_CLR=
  <11E8B> O-Onee-sama, you don't mean...=
  <11F25> We'll be together a-a-all night long until  　　morning. Dinner, a bath, and bedtime, yes?=
  <11FF3> Onee-sama gave me a sweet gentle smile.=
  <120E2> GS_CLR=
  <12177> Eee.... eee.... eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?!?=
  <1220E> My screams echoed throughout the            　　neighbourhood.... well, maybe...=
