  <08A6> *fidget* *fidget*=
  <097F> GS_CLR=
  <0A14> And so, I hope you'll forgive Nanami-san and　　I going home early.=
  <0ACB> *fidget* *fidget*=
  <0B58> That's quite alright, please leave the      　　committee business to me, then.=
  <0C23> I really do apologize for this. Pleasant day　　to you, then.=
  <0CDC> Pleasant day to you, Yuuna-san.=
  <0D6F> *fidget* *fidget*=
  <0E7F> GS_CLR=
  <0F1D> .............=
  <1029> GS_CLR=
  <10C7> Nanami-san?=
  <11D1> GS_CLR=
  <126F> Eh? Ah, yes!=
  <12F7> Nanami-san, are you sure you're alright?=
  <1393> The other committee member (a classmate of  　　Onee-sama's, it seems) took a close look at 　　my face with a concerned look.=
  <148D> Your face is quite red... I still think you 　　might have a fever.=
  <15CF> GS_CLR=
  <166D> Um, well, that's...=
  <16F4> Of course, it was no fever that had made my 　　face turn red like this...=
  <183D> GS_CLR=
  <18DB> Well, let's get you home so you can get some　　rest, alright.=
  <1A18> GS_CLR=
  <1AB6> Ah, alright...=
  <1B38> Pulled along by Onee-sama's hand, we leave  　　the committee room behind us.=
  <1CE4> GS_CUD=
  <1DBC> GS_CLR=
  <1E51> Haaa... I thought my heart was going to leap　　out of my chest...=
  <1F07> Now, with the two of us alone, Onee-sama let　　out a big breath.=
  <1FBC> For some reason, she really looked to be    　　enjoying herself.=
  <20FC> GS_CLR=
  <219A> That's -my- line. My chest was really       　　pounding from all of that.=
  <2260> You're so cute when you're fidgeting like   　　that, Nanami♪=
  <239D> GS_CLR=
  <243B> Oooh, and just who's fault is that, I       　　wonder!=
  <2571> GS_CLR=
  <260F> Nanami, if you keep moving around fast like 　　that...=
  <2745> GS_CLR=
  <27E3> Eh? Aa, kyaa!?=
  <2865> When the meaning of Onee-sama's words hit   　　me, I quickly grabbed onto my skirt, pinning　　it down with both hands.=
  <2951> Why am I so concerned about my skirt, you   　　ask?=
  <29F9> Because, to be frank, I'm not wearing any   　　panties right now.=
  <2B3A> GS_CLR=
  <2BD8> Haaa...=
  <2C53> I'm not even really sure how they came to be　　removed.=
  <2CFF> The feeling of cool air directly on my      　　bottom and the spirited way my skirt behaved　　with every step I took made me walk very    　　carefully indeed.=
  <2E14> As to how all this happened, the answer was 　　simple.=
  <2EBF> A short while ago, in secret with Onee-sama,　　my panties had gotten, well...=
  <300C> GS_CLR=
  <30AA> You must be really sensitive, Nanami, if you　　react as strongly as that♪=
  <31F4> GS_CLR=
  <3292> O-Onee-sama!=
  <3312> That was what had happened.=
  <33A1> I had reacted so strongly that I had wet my 　　panties past any consideration of putting   　　them back on again.=
  <3488> Incidentally, those wet panties were        　　currently packed in my school bag wrapped up　　in a plastic bag.=
  <356D> I'd have to wash them myself when I got     　　home, before my mother could discover them.=
  <36C7> GS_CLR=
  <3765> Th-that's because of all those... terribly  　　indecent things... you were doing, Onee-    　　sama...=
  <38CB> GS_CLR=
  <3969> Wait, are you saying that it was my fault?=
  <3A92> GS_CLR=
  <3B30> It was your fault.=
  <3C41> GS_CLR=
  <3CDF> Uuuh... you're so mean, Nanami.... *sob*=
  <3D7B> Onee-sama clamped a hand over her mouth,    　　shaking.=
  <3EB2> GS_CLR=
  <3F50> That was only because how unbearably cute   　　you are, Nanami - I just couldn't help      　　myself...=
  <402D> Her response didn't sound natural at all.=
  <40CA> But there really wasn't anything else I     　　could say.=
  <4203> GS_CLR=
  <42A1> Onee-sama's.... sneaky...=
  <43B9> GS_CLR=
  <4457> Uuhehehee♪=
  <44D6> Aagh, Onee-sama! You're enjoying this a     　　little too much!=
  <4592> Come come now, let's get going. If you keep 　　going without panties like you are, you're  　　going to catch a cold♪=
  <4708> GS_CLR=
  <47A6> O-Onee-sama!!=
  <4920> GS_CUD=
  <49BC> Two truant committee members, on their way  　　back home.=
  <4A6A> Incidentally, Onee-sama's house was         　　practically right next to the St. Michael's 　　campus.=
  <4B45> It's even closer than the nearby station    　　that I take every day.=
  <4BFF> On top of that, despite being in the city,  　　this neighbourhood was a high-class         　　residential area.=
  <4CE4> To have a home in this neighbourhood, one's 　　family had to be considerably affluent...=
  <4E05> GS_CLR=
  <4E9A> Hmm-hmm-hmm♪=
  <4F1B> Onee-sama, happily humming away...=
  <4FB1> One might think that her personality had    　　completely changed.=
  <5068> But only I knew that this actually was Onee-　　sama's true self.=
  <511D> My Onee-sama, always dignified and imposing,　　and yet kind and gentle to everyone.=
  <51E5> Truthfully, she can be amazingly clueless at　　times.... and others, a little naughty.=
  <52B0> Those are the kinds of things that make up  　　the Onee-sama I love so much.=
  <53FC> GS_CLR=
  <549A> Aah, Onee-sama...=
  <55AA> GS_CLR=
  <5648> Yessy, Nanami?=
  <5755> GS_CLR=
  <57F3> Well, it's just... would it be alright if we　　held hands?=
  <592D> GS_CLR=
  <59CB> Held hands?=
  <5A4A> Just for a moment, a curious look passed    　　over Onee-sama's face.=
  <5B04> And then...=
  <5C0E> GS_CLR=
  <5CAC> Ah, yes, that would be fine.=
  <5D3C> I desperately resisted the urge to jump in  　　the air crying out in joy.=
  <5DFA> Doing that kind of thing would flip my skirt　　up completely!=
  <5EB4> So, then...=
  <5F33> Timidly, I stretched out my hand, and took  　　hold of Onee-sama's arm.=
  <6028> GS_EN_NS=
  <60B1> Onee-sama....=
  <6132> I entwined my fingers around Onee-sama's    　　soft hand.=
  <61E0> And then, clinging to her arm, I pressed my 　　body up against her.=
  <62A0> Nanami, I think you're getting spoiled.=
  <6343> Eheehee...=
  <63C1> There was a wonderful smell when I nuzzled  　　my face against Onee-sama's arm.=
  <6485> It was as if Onee-sama's whole body was     　　gently wrapped in that scent.=
  <6546> To be able to be like this with Onee-       　　sama....=
  <65FA> Aaaaw.... kyuu...=
  <667F> For some reason, the expression on Onee-    　　sama's face kept changing.=
  <6745> Um, Onee-sama? Is something wrong?=
  <67E3> It's ok, I'm enduring it...=
  <687A> Enduring what?=
  <6904> You're being so unbearably cute, Nanami - if　　I don't control myself, I'm going to jump on　　you right here and now!=
  <69F7> Wha-?! What kind of a thought is that to    　　have in a place like this!?=
  <6ABE> But-but-but....=
  <6B49> Don't make a face like that! Why is it that 　　you have turn everything into something     　　indecent?!=
  <6C2F> That's because... I keep thinking about how 　　you're not wearing any panties...=
  <6CFC> Wha-!?=
  <6D7E> Unexpectedly finding herself without her    　　panties, ready to cry if she doesn't get    　　home soon...=
  <6E66> Squirming helplessly, her body twisting     　　about in the shame of her fall from grace...　　wah!=
  <6F46> O, Onee-sama!!=
  <6FD0> Haa, haa.... Nanami, you bad, bad little    　　girl...=
  <707B> Onee-sama wiped pained sweat from her brow.=
  <7122> Sometimes I wonder if dirty thoughts are all　　that there is inside your head, Onee-sama!=
  <71F8> Th-that's mean, Nanami... You know it's only　　because I love you so much--=
  <72C0> Even so, please stop twisting everything    　　into something indecent.=
  <7384> Aaaw... but, but... I don't think there's   　　anything wrong about being a little         　　indecent.=
  <7469> If they are out of love, how can these      　　feelings be a bad thing?=
  <752D> Saying something dirty is already going too 　　far, I think.=
  <75E6> Aaah, Nanami, so calmly digging away at     　　me...=
  <768F> That was surprisingly weak at the last      　　moment, wasn't it Onee-sama...=
  <7759> Aah, well.... even I understand that        　　overdoing it isn't good, alright?=
  <7826> It's just that there's this... lovely       　　unbearable feeling... that you really stir  　　up inside of me....=
  <7915> I just can't help running wild sometimes!=
  <79B2> Struggling desperately, Onee-sama explained 　　herself.=
  <7A5E> The way things were going, I feared that    　　there might come a time when I wouldn't care　　for the idea of sex at all.=
  <7B55> Love is the reason that I'm thinking of you 　　night after night, playing with myself over 　　and over and over again...=
  <7C4B> Gah, I'm not listening to this! Not here,   　　not while we're in the middle of the street!=
  <7D23> Things like where you are don't matter -    　　love doesn't care!=
  <7DE1> You're talking crazy again...=
  <7E7A> Are you telling me that you don't do such   　　things, Nanami?! You don't play with        　　yourself at all?!=
  <7F67> Eh?!?=
  <7FE8> I did it three times in a single night, you 　　know!=
  <8099> Hey, not so loud!=
  <8126> Nanami! Do you or don't you!?=
  <81BF> Um, that's...=
  <8248> Which is it!?=
  <82D1> ....I do, but....=
  <835E> Haa... that's a relief. I was starting to   　　think it really was just me.=
  <8426> Tell me again why we're having this kind of 　　conversation in the middle of the street...=
  <84FD> Aah...=
  <857F> Ooh... Onee-sama, you dummy...=
  <8619> Aaauuu... I'm so sorry...=
  <86A6> Onee-sama has been running wild since the   　　beginning of our relationship.=
  <8768> I wonder, would it be best to try to snap   　　this into her once and for all, right here  　　and now?=
  <88E9> Onee-sama.=
  <896F> Y-yessy?=
  <89F3> Onee-sama, you've been getting a little too 　　carried away lately.=
  <8AB3> You used to be so straight and reserved     　　before, remember?=
  <8B70> Th-that was what love did to me...=
  <8C0E> Nevertheless!=
  <8C97> If you don't start showing a little more    　　restraint, sooner or later there are going  　　to be rumours at school about us.=
  <8D94> And if that happens... we might not be able 　　to be together anymore... and I couldn't    　　bear such a thing.=
  <8E82> Nanami...=
  <8EFF> Was it just my imagination, or was there    　　sadness in her voice?=
  <8FC0> I'm sorry, Nanami. But, I am glad you told  　　me...=
  <9069> With those words, Onee-sama took out a      　　handkerchief, and wiped away the tears that 　　had gathered in my eyes.=
  <9188> No, if I say something like that, it will   　　just make Onee-sama cry.=
  <9244> She's normally so calm and refined, but     　　around me she becomes like a little child.=
  <9312> Which is her true self, I don't really      　　know...=
  <93BD> She shows her childlike side only to me.=
  <9459> Eeheehee. Maybe that is kind of nice.=
  <94FA> Is something wrong? Nanami?=
  <9591> Ah, no, nothing at all...=
  <9626> Putting that aside, where is it that we're  　　going, Onee-sama?=
  <96DB> Both of us truant from the committee        　　meeting, I belatedly realized that Onee-sama　　seemed to be leading us somewhere specific.=
  <97E2> Oh, didn't I tell you?=
  <9874> You did not. I had been wondering what it   　　could be that would make it alright to be   　　truant from the committee meeting....=
  <996D> Truthfully though, it just hadn't occurred  　　to me to ask until now.=
  <9A30> Well, let's just say... it's a very nice    　　place♪=
  <9AE3> A "nice place"? That's not really an answer 　　at all.=
  <9B96> Uuheehee.... Now, now, you'll see～♪=
  <9C2F> Laughter was her only further response.=
  <9CCA> Ah, it's alright.=
  <9D57> After all, we're out here walking together  　　hand in hand because of it.=
  <9E1E> Did you say something?=
  <9EB0> No, it was nothing. Just thinking out loud.=
  <9F4F> Then, just as I had smiled to cover up that 　　little excuse......=
  <A0FA> Kyaa!?=
  <A174> A sudden terrible gust of wind attacked us.=
  <A21B> Oh no.... my hair is getting all messed up.=
  <A2BA> I grabbed at my hair for dear life,         　　desperately trying to keep it from flying   　　all about.=
  <A3A0> N-Nanami....=
  <A428> Huh....?=
  <A4A4> I realized that Onee-sama was looking at me 　　with a strange expression on her face.=
  <A576> What's the matter, Onee-sama?=
  <A60F> S-skirt.... panties....=
  <A6A2> Skirt... panties...?=
  <A72A> It seemed that I had completely forgotten   　　something.=
  <A7D8> The little bit about not having any panties 　　on at the moment...=
  <A8CA> GS_EN_NS=
  <A955> Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!?!=
  <A9DE> I desperately pinned down my skirt with my  　　hands, but it was too late.=
  <AA9D> My valuables had already been completely    　　exposed.=
  <AB49> And to make matters worse...=
  <ABD9> Hey, that girl's got skin-coloured          　　underpants!=
  <AC88> Skin coloured underpants! Skin coloured     　　underpants!=
  <AD37> A group of children passing by had clearly  　　seen everything...=
  <AE27> GS_CUD=
  <AEFF> GS_CLR=
  <AF94> I... can't... take this...!!=
  <B078> GS_CLR=
  <B10D> Aah, Nanami?! Where are you going?! Nanami!?=
  <B1AD> Shaking off Onee-sama's cries of protest, I 　　blindly ran away from that place as fast as 　　I was able.=
