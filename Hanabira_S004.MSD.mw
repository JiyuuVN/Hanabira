  >> <0851> Kiss of Love=

  <08FD> GS_CUD=
  <0999> I was barely able to sleep last night.=
  <0A33> I wasn't able to stop longing for Yuuna-    　　senpai - pardon me - Onee-sama, and the     　　secret that we now shared.=
  <0B21> However, Onee-sama's idea that we start     　　calling each other "Onee-sama" and "Nanami" 　　openly at the Academy was outlandish!=
  <0C1A> If we did something like that, the whole    　　campus would be in an uproar.=
  <0CDB> Would the school infirmary even be able to  　　handle all of the fainting students?=
  <0DA3> Besides... this happiness is something I'd  　　like to keep secret for a while.=
  <0E67> That way I'd be able to spend more sweet    　　hours alone with Onee-sama.=
  <0F26> I want to meet with Onee-sama as soon as    　　possible.=
  <0FD3> And then, I want to just idly talk about    　　things...=
  <1080> Things about her...=
  <1107> Things about me...=
  <118D> I want this day to be over so we could be   　　together.=
  <123A> And then... and then...=
  <12FF> GS_CUD=
  <138B> Nanami-san, pleasant day to you.=
  <1473> GS_CLR=
  <1508> ....eh?=
  <1583> An unexpected greeting shocked me out of my 　　reverie.=
  <162F> It would not be good if the kind of things  　　that I had been thinking about became known.=
  <16FF> But that greeting didn't seem to indicate   　　anything of the sort.=
  <180C> GS_CLR=
  <18A1> Pleasant day to you.=
  <1931> ...Ah? In good spirits today, I see.=
  <1A1D> GS_CLR=
  <1AB2> Eh?=
  <1B31> That much is clearly written across your    　　face.=
  <1BDA> Eeek.=
  <1C53> What kind of expression must I have been    　　making to be seen through that easily?=
  <1D71> GS_CLR=
  <1E06> W-well, yesterday... the flowers in my      　　garden started to bloom.=
  <1ECA> Aah, that is lovely, yes.=
  <1FAB> GS_CLR=
  <2040> It took a lot of care to raise them, so I   　　can't help but look happy it seems.=
  <210F> Nanami-san, you cultivated them personally?=
  <2202> GS_CLR=
  <2297> Yes, well...=
  <231F> You did not have a gardener tending to them 　　for you?=
  <23D3> A g-gardener!?=
  <245D> Why the surprise? That is normal, is it not?=
  <2505> Were I to get my hands soiled, I would get  　　quite the scolding from Father.=
  <261C> GS_CLR=
  <26B1> Aah, I see.=
  <2730> As expected, I was different from these     　　proper ladies.=
  <27E2> Their world was far different than the one I　　was from, and I couldn't help but admire it.=
  <28B2> At that same time, a noisy commotion        　　developed nearby.=
  <29B7> GS_CLR=
  <2A44> I turned about to get a look at what was    　　going on.=
  <2AF1> There was just one person standing there,   　　but it was the very person I most wanted to 　　meet with at the moment.=
  <2C31> GS_CLR=
  <2CC6> Pleasant day to you.=
  <2D4E> On seeing me, Onee-sama displayed one of her　　finest smiles.=
  <2E00> I thought that I was going to faint at that 　　exceedingly beautiful sight.=
  <2EC0> Why was Onee-sama coming down the corridor  　　towards the first-year classrooms?=
  <2F86> In any case though, I still needed to greet 　　her.=
  <30B9> GS_CLR=
  <3157> Pleasant day to yo-=
  <31E6> Pleasant day to you, Yuuna-senpai!=
  <3284> Pleasant day to you!=
  <3397> GS_CLR=
  <3435> Uh... aa, au...=
  <34B8> These usually soft-talking future ladies    　　were acting quite differently in front of   　　Yuuna-senpai.=
  <3599> With flushed faces, they scrambled to offer 　　their greetings.=
  <364D> Even under the unexpected assault, Onee-    　　sama's expression remained steadfast.=
  <3716> Like a lovely flower, surrounded by         　　students, she gently nodded in greetings.=
  <37EB> Pleasant day to you, everyone.=
  <387D> The corridor resounded with shrill voices in　　response.=
  <392A> Onee-sama's voice pierced my heart as well.=
  <39C9> Onee-sama, lovely from head to toe.=
  <3A60> Her voice was every bit as lovely as well...=
  <3B08> Yuuna-senpai has been happy like this all   　　morning...=
  <3BB6> Uhuh.=
  <3C37> And yet still carrying herself about with   　　such grace, as always.=
  <3CF1> Of course, it was perfectly natural for     　　everyone to admire Onee-sama like that!=
  <3DC4> Lovely personality as well, the perfect     　　lady.=
  <3E6D> With that, I had to completely agree.=
  <3F06> Well, perhaps a little too tall to be       　　completely ideal for me, but still...=
  <3FD7> How lovely it would be to become friends    　　with Yuuna-senpai.=
  <4095> Oh, you intend to actually try?=
  <4130> *giggle* Honestly, I don't think I would be 　　able to approach her.=
  <41F1> I understand what you mean, yes.=
  <428D> ......=
  <4307> I had felt the same way.=
  <4393> Completely unapproachable, someone to be    　　yearned for from afar.=
  <444D> Now though... I still could not really      　　believe it, but...=
  <4503> Onee-sama had confessed her love to me....=
  <45A1> And now I was that special person in Onee-  　　sama's life.=
  <46DC> GS_CLR=
  <477A> Nanami-san.=
  <4884> GS_CLR=
  <4922> Eeyai!=
  <499C> ...eep...=
  <4A19> Suddenly being addressed, I had let out a   　　strange yelp.=
  <4ACA> Did Onee-sama think that was odd, I         　　wonder...=
  <4B77> I timidly raised my face, and saw that Onee-　　sama seemed to be on the verge of bursting  　　out into laughter.=
  <4C5D> Relief or misery, I wasn't sure what I was  　　feeling.=
  <4D94> GS_CLR=
  <4E32> Nanami-san, pleasant day to you as well.=
  <4F59> GS_CLR=
  <4FF7> Pleasant day to you, One-... Yuuna-senpai.=
  <5095> It did not go unnoticed that, out of        　　everyone there, I had been the only one     　　greeted by name.=
  <5181> Nanami-san, do you and Senpai actually know 　　each other!?=
  <52BC> GS_CLR=
  <535A> Ah... from the Environmental Protection     　　Committee...=
  <5412> Ah, yes, that was the case, was it not?=
  <5538> GS_CLR=
  <55D6> I see a lot of promise in her.=
  <5668> A chorus of gasps resounded.=
  <56F8> Being noticed by Onee-sama that much was an 　　amazing thing.=
  <57AA> However, I couldn't say the same about      　　standing out like that in front of          　　everyone...=
  <5889> But if it meant being able to be alone with 　　Onee-sama, it was fine by me.=
  <59D5> GS_CLR=
  <5A73> Keep up the good work, Nanami-san.=
  <5B94> GS_CLR=
  <5C32> Y-yes, ma'am.=
  <5CBB> *giggle*=
  <5DC2> GS_CLR=
  <5E60> I gather that you're on this floor for some 　　errand...?=
  <5F99> GS_CLR=
  <6037> Yes, of course. I came to meet with you,    　　Nanami-san.=
  <6171> GS_CLR=
  <620F> Eh?=
  <628E> There were some committee matters that I    　　needed to discuss with you. Shall we go?=
  <63E5> GS_CLR=
  <6483> Y-yes...=
  <64FF> What kind of committee matters, I wonder.=
  <659C> The other students stared at me enviously.=
  <663A> With my movements stiffened by nervous      　　tension, I proceeded to Onee-sama's side.=
  <670F> So Yuuna-senpai really did come here to meet　　with Nanami-san then.=
  <67D0> For such a thing, perhaps I should have run 　　for committee membership as well.=
  <689D> Actually, rumour has it that those who were 　　just interested in Senpai were removed from 　　consideration.=
  <6987> Is that so?=
  <6A0E> So, Nanami-san actually was interested in   　　the committee itself?=
  <6ACF> Quite amazing to show that kind of          　　enthusiasm for extracurricular activities,  　　isn't it.=
  <6BB4> Perhaps the rest of us could learn a few    　　things from Nanami-san.=
  <6C6F> To that, my classmates nodded in agreement.=
  <6D0E> Of course, getting close to Onee-sama had   　　been my goal as well, but there's no way I  　　could admit to -that-.=
  <6DF8> Trying to judge Onee-sama's appearance, I   　　wondered if her coming to escort me like    　　this was anything special.=
  <6EE6> At the very least, I needed to keep any     　　embarrassing thoughts about Onee-sama at    　　bay.=
  <7049> GS_CLR=
  <70E7> Nanami-san?=
  <71F1> GS_CLR=
  <728F> Ah, yes!=
  <730B> Onee-sama watched me with curiosity where I 　　had frozen in place before her.=
  <73CE> Turning a little bit red, I hurriedly chased　　after Onee-sama.=
  <74CA> GS_CUD=
  <7566> I was brought along to a currently unused   　　classroom.=
  <7614> The room seemed meticulously clean, the air 　　clear and fresh.=
  <76C8> Even though it was sultry out in the        　　corridor, inside felt refreshingly cool.=
  <77E8> GS_CLR=
  <787D> Onee-sama, about that committee business...=
  <79A7> GS_CLR=
  <7A45> It's nothing like that, actually.=
  <7B65> GS_CLR=
  <7C03> Eh??=
  <7D06> GS_CLR=
  <7DA4> Then... well... why...?=
  <7EBA> GS_CLR=
  <7F58> I just wanted to talk with you alone.=
  <807C> GS_CLR=
  <811A> Wha-eh??=
  <8221> GS_CLR=
  <82BF> Nanami, you certainly are popular with your 　　classmates, aren't you?=
  <837A> Onee-sama pouted, puffing her cheeks out a  　　little.=
  <84B0> GS_CLR=
  <854E> Well... wait, what?=
  <8660> GS_CLR=
  <86FE> I said that you certainly are popular.=
  <8798> Wha...?=
  <8813> What was she thinking that she came to that 　　kind of misunderstanding?=
  <88D0> Does she really not at all notice the height　　of her own popularity?=
  <898A> The cold, distant way she was talking wasn't　　normal either.=
  <8AC7> GS_CLR=
  <8B65> When I tried to call out to you, everyone   　　was talking to you..=
  <8C25> And you seemed to be enjoying the           　　attention...=
  <8CDD> This is a misunderstanding.=
  <8DF7> GS_CLR=
  <8E95> I don't think so. That's exactly what I saw.=
  <8F3D> The reason I looked happy wasn't because    　　everyone was talking to me...=
  <9006> It's unsightly to make excuses like that,   　　you know.=
  <913E> GS_CLR=
  <91DC> That was not an excuse!=
  <92F2> GS_CLR=
  <9390> On top of that, you were acting so formal   　　with everyone else there, Nanami.=
  <945D> I just couldn't bear that at all!=
  <94F2> Onee-sama was frowning and sulking in front 　　of me.=
  <959C> Coming from lovely Onee-sama, this was just 　　a little bit cute.=
  <9652> And at any rate, it seemed that Onee-sama   　　wanted me completely to herself.=
  <9716> You could say that that just showed how much　　she really loved me.=
  <97CE> Wa-wa-wa... I feel so happy!=
  <985E> For Onee-sama, I'll gladly devote myself    　　entirely to her, and more!=
  <99A7> GS_CLR=
  <9A45> Allow me make this as clear as possible.=
  <9B6C> GS_CLR=
  <9C0A> ...yes?=
  <9D10> GS_CLR=
  <9DAE> The one that I love is you, Onee-sama, and  　　you alone.=
  <9E64> I looked happy because I had been thinking  　　about you, Onee-sama.=
  <9F25> So, what happened was just bad timing, I    　　guess you'd say...=
  <9FDB> My face burned with embarrassment.=
  <A071> I had just confessed my love to her all over　　again.=
  <A1A6> GS_CLR=
  <A244> Truthfully......?=
  <A2D1> It was just a bit of bad luck, then?=
  <A369> I took a deep breath.=
  <A3FA> I wouldn't lie to you, Onee-sama. Please    　　believe me.=
  <A534> GS_CLR=
  <A5D2> ............=
  <A65A> Give me a kiss, then I'll believe you.=
  <A77F> GS_CLR=
  <A81D> Huh?=
  <A895> What does that have to do with anything?!=
  <A93A> If you kiss me, I'll know you love me.=
  <AA5F> GS_CLR=
  <AAFD> Haauu...=
  <AB79> You're making it hard for me to breathe,    　　Onee-sama...=
  <AC29> Haa... haa...=
  <ACB2> B-but, classes are going to start soon...=
  <AD57> Then you'd better hurry, please.=
  <ADEB> Uuu... I guess I didn't have much choice...=
  <AE8A> Stretching myself up in front of Onee-sama, 　　I gently kissed her cheek.=
  <AF9C> GS_CLR=
  <B031> Well then... *chwack*=
  <B10E> GS_CLR=
  <B1A3> ............=
  <B277> GS_CLR=
  <B30C> On the cheek isn't good enough.=
  <B42A> GS_CLR=
  <B4C8> Eeeh?!=
  <B54A> Unless it's on the lips, I'm not going to   　　believe you.=
  <B685> GS_CLR=
  <B723> That's.... embarrassing.=
  <B83A> GS_CLR=
  <B8D8> Nanami doesn't really love me after all...=
  <B97E> I do love you! Of course I love you! It's   　　just......=
  <BAB7> GS_CLR=
  <BB55> A kiss then, if you please♪=
  <BBE5> Onee-sama closed her eyes.=
  <BC73> Her eyes were like gems, and even closed    　　they were as beautiful as ever.=
  <BD36> Her beautifully-sculpted lips, kissing      　　them...=
  <BDE1> However, this business about not being      　　believed was bothering me.=
  <BE9F> I was feeling a little manipulated.=
  <BF3E> Well then... if I may...=
  <BFCA> Lifting my heels off the floor, I brought   　　myself close to her pink lips.=
  <C08C> Alarm bells started going off in my chest,  　　trying to warn me of the approaching danger.=
  <C195> GS_EN_NS=
  <C21E> *chwa...*=
  <C29B> Without a moment's hesitation, Onee-sama    　　wrapped her arms tightly around me.=
  <C362> And then, using that as a distraction, slid 　　her tongue into my mouth.=
  <C427> Nn... mphf... uuh.. Onee-sama...=
  <C4C3> I have you now! And you will not escape me  　　again... *chwack*=
  <C580> mmph...!=
  <C604> I'm not handing you over to anyone, Nanami.=
  <C6AB> Now you are mine. My prisoner.=
  <C745> Prisoner...? haaa... *chwack*=
  <C7D6> Onee-sama's sweet voice echoed in my ears.=
  <C874> Slick with saliva, her tongue tenderly      　　caressed my own.=
  <C930> nn... mmm....=
  <C9B1> My body shivered as it started to go numb.=
  <CA57> Onee...sama...=
  <CAD9> Unconsciously, my arms wrapped around Onee- 　　sama and returned her embrace.=
  <CB9B> A gentle warmth burned through the insides  　　of my head, and my awareness started to     　　gradually dim.=
  <CC85> nnn... aahmn... *chwack* *chwa*...=
  <CD23> Your kisses... completely enchanting...=
  <CDC6> So adorable, Nanami... *chwack*=
  <CE61> Onee-sama, your tongue... like that,        　　hnmph... nnn..=
  <CF1B> Is here alright then? *chwa* *chwawah*=
  <CFBD> Don't be so mean, please... nn, haa.. *chwa*　　*chwah*=
  <D068> The tips of our tongues rubbing together was　　unbearably pleasant.=
  <D120> Onee-sama's tongue started exploring every  　　inch of the insides of my mouth.=
  <D1EC> nmnnn.... *chwack* *chwa* nnnmmnn...=
  <D28C> I want to taste every bit of you, Nanami,   　　very soon...=
  <D344> Eh?=
  <D3BB> Pulling away from my surprised face, Onee-  　　sama gave me a threatening smile.=
  <D488> Hehumm...=
  <D50D> Onee-sama...?=
  <D596> Resign yourself, Nanami.=
  <D62A> Y-yes, ma'am!=
  <D6AB> Ack! I didn't mean to say that!=
  <D746> Soon, Nanami, I will be kissing your lovely 　　petals as well, yes?=
  <D806> Petals?=
  <D881> After a moment's incomprehension, I started 　　to realize what she was talking about...=
  <D955> Yes indeed, petals of a softly-coloured     　　rose♪=
  <D9FF> Onee-sama whispered those words into to my  　　ear, and my entire face caught fire in an   　　instant.=
  <DAE3> Y-y-you m-m-mean...!?=
  <DB74> Ah, but perhaps you've already resigned     　　yourself to that, yes?=
  <DC36> Aauh... aauh, auauauaah...=
  <DCC4> That was the only reply I could make!=
  <DD5D> How could I simply resign myself to anything　　after suddenly being told something like    　　that?!=
  <DE37> Just being like we were now was wonderful   　　enough... as for something like 'that'...=
  <DF04> Such an idea was simply too mind-blowing to 　　even consider!=
  <DFBE> Your mouth is flapping open and shut like a 　　little goldfish - what is it that you're    　　trying to say?=
  <E0A8> A-are you serious?=
  <E12E> I asked with a strangled voice as Onee-sama 　　watched me with a face full of curiousity.=
  <E204> Why wouldn't I be?=
- <E292> "Why?"...=
  <E317> When you share your thoughts and feelings   　　with someone, being physically intimate is  　　only natural, isn't it?=
  <E402> Only natural indeed.=
  <E492> You don't want to?=
  <E520> I didn't say anything like that at all!=
  <E5BB> Augh! I replied without thinking again...=
  <E658> Wait, no - that really was what I wanted to 　　say.=
  <E708> Wonderful. *chwack*=
  <E797> nn... nn, aah....=
  <E824> But... I... classes...=
  <E8B6> So?=
  <E935> S-so... nn-nn... nyaa....=
  <E9C2> Once again, Onee-sama brought our lips      　　together.=
  <EA6F> And once again, I became enchanted by those 　　soft lips pressing against my own...=
