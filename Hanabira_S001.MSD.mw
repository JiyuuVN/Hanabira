  >> <0971> After-School Shock=

  <0C54> GS_CUD=
  <0CD8> It happened in April, as the sakura trees   　　danced.=
  <0D83> I stood there, my body clad in a brand-new  　　uniform.=
  <0E2F> Perhaps because I wasn't yet used to wearing　　it, I kept worrying about the length of my  　　uniform's skirt.=
  <0F13> Alone, separated from the line of freshmen, 　　I kept trying to fix my uniform.=
  <102B> GS_CLR=
  <10C0> Why is this happening...?=
  <114D> I had been yearning to wear this bean-jam   　　coloured uniform for a long time.=
  <1212> But I hadn't anticipated this...=
  <12FA> GS_CLR=
  <138F> Uuu... It doesn't look right. I'm not cute  　　at all.=
  <143A> Despite how adorable the uniform was, it    　　wasn't making me so - not in the slightest.=
  <1509> Not only that, but my little vanity of      　　ordering a uniform one size too small had   　　been a mistake.=
  <15EC> Simply put, it was -tight-.=
  <167B> A dark green stripe ran along the uniform's 　　white collar.=
  <172C> On the breast of the uniform, a large ribbon　　of the same dark green swayed sweetly.=
  <17F6> Just those alone would have made for a      　　lovely uniform, but my favourite was        　　something else yet.=
  <18DD> The best part of all was a second ribbon on 　　the back, right at the top edge of the one- 　　piece, pleated skirt.=
  <19C6> The first time I saw the uniform, I thought 　　it looked just like a bunny tail.=
  <1A8B> That was the first little spark that had set　　all of this in motion.=
  <1B45> Just from that, my heart had decided.=
  <1BDE> That someday, I too would put on that       　　uniform.=
  <1C8A> And that I wanted to go on to attend St.    　　Michael's Girls Academy.=
  <1D46> When I told her this, my mother laughed at  　　me. My homeroom teacher's only response was 　　a sour look.=
  <1E26> I understood why.=
  <1EAB> With my grades, getting accepted seemed like　　nothing more than a dream within a dream...=
  <1F7A> Without a streak of a hundred miracles      　　happening, the idea sounded completely      　　ludicrous.=
  <2058> Even so, I persisted.=
  <20E1> I studied eight hours a day, every day.=
  <217C> Even hateful mathematics, which I attacked  　　with insane desperation.=
  <2238> Honestly, I can be pretty stubborn.=
  <22CF> When people told me how ridiculous the idea 　　was, it only made me want to prove them     　　wrong with everything I had.=
  <23BF> It seemed that, for once, I had been able to　　put my stubborn streak to good use...=
  <2488> And so, elated with success, I, Oda Nanami, 　　was accepted into St. Michael's Girls       　　Academy.=
  <2564> And that was how, amidst the sakura trees in　　their full April bloom, I had found myself  　　at the school's opening ceremony.=
  <2693> GS_CUD=
  <276B> GS_CLR=
  <2800> Uuu... this isn't right... it wasn't        　　supposed to be like this...=
  <28BF> However much I tried to fix my uniform, it  　　still didn't seem right to me.=
  <29D5> GS_CLR=
  <2A6A> Come on already... Why did I have to get one　　size smaller, anyway?=
  <2B23> I recalled how Mother had been telling me to　　get a larger one, so I'd have room to grow  　　if I needed it.=
  <2C06> At that time, the size of the uniform wasn't　　a problem... barely.=
  <2CBE> And yet...=
  <2D90> GS_CLR=
  <2E25> Did it really have to be the very day of the　　opening ceremony that I outgrew my uniform?!=
  <2F49> GS_CLR=
  <2FDE> It had to have been that cake we had to     　　celebrate my being accepted. Mother really  　　splurged on such a big one, after all.=
  <30E0> Really, it wasn't as if I had intended to   　　eat three whole pieces like that...=
  <31A7> That was it.=
  <3227> Please don't try to tell me that I shouldn't　　be passing the blame onto others.=
  <32EC> Sweets to a girl are like catnip to cats.=
  <3389> That kind of intense temptation - how could 　　a delicate thing like me be expected to     　　resist?=
  <34B8> GS_CLR=
  <354D> When I get home, I'll have to see if I can  　　get the waist area loosened up a bit.=
  <3616> While I was at it, my bottom could also do  　　with a little more room.=
  <36DA> At any rate, if I can just make it though   　　the opening ceremony...=
  <3795> That was when...=
  <38A8> GS_CLR=
  <393D> Eh?=
  <39B4> ... I heard a very ominous sound.=
  <3A49> Looking, I saw my now tragically torn skirt.=
  <3AE9> Caught upon a long pointed branch jutting   　　out from the thicket, the pleat of my skirt 　　had been cruelly torn asunder.=
  <3BE3> This isn't happening!=
  <3C6C> Sometimes, God can be unbelievably cruel.=
  <3D09> How I had been looking forward to this day.=
  <3DA8> I had gotten so excited last night, trying  　　to imagine what life would be like here, I  　　had been almost unable to sleep at all.=
  <3EA3> And yet, why...=
  <3F7A> GS_CLR=
  <400F> Uu... uuwah...=
  <4091> The opening ceremony that I had worked so   　　hard to get to... The uniform that I had    　　been yearning after for so long...=
  <41DB> GS_CLR=
  <4270> Enough already! *sniff*=
  <42FB> Tears overflowed.=
  <4380> The way things were, I just wanted to go    　　back home.=
  <4436> Why are you crying? What's wrong?=
  <451F> GS_CLR=
  <45B4> Eh...?=
  <462E> Unexpectedly, a voice called out.=
  <46CB> To be crying like that in a place like      　　this... did something happen?=
  <478C> With a very gentle voice, someone was       　　speaking to me.=
  <4893> GS_CLR=
  <4928> Ah.....=
  <49A3> At that moment, with no worries over being  　　seen in such a miserable state, I lost      　　myself in the sight of -this person- whom   　　had appeared before my eyes.=
  <4AC3> A vision of the Virgin Mary herself...=
  <4B5D> She could have just stepped out of a        　　church's stained glass window...=
  <4C21> No... From her appearance, she must have    　　descended down from Heaven itself.=
  <4D3B> GS_CLR=
  <4DD0> Oh my... Your skirt really got torn up,     　　didn't it.=
  <4F09> GS_CLR=
  <4FA7> Eh!? Ah, um, well......=
  <50BD> GS_CLR=
  <515B> Wait just a moment and let me mend that up  　　for you.=
  <5207> With those words, this woman who had        　　appeared so suddenly knelt down directly    　　beside me.=
  <52E5> And then, producing a sewing kit from       　　somewhere, she began mending with what      　　appeared to be a well-experienced hand.=
  <546B> GS_CLR=
  <5509> A freshman, yes?=
  <5618> GS_CLR=
  <56B6> Y-yes. Yes, ma'am! I am a freshman!=
  <5755> Would it be alright if I asked your name?=
  <57FA> Na-Nanami, ma'am. Written like 'seven seas',　　Nanami!=
  <5930> GS_CLR=
  <59CE> So, Nanami-san, then... a lovely name.=
  <5AF3> GS_CLR=
  <5B91> Aauu...=
  <5C0C> At the words 'a lovely name', I immediately 　　blushed.=
  <5CB8> It felt as if all the blood in my body had  　　suddenly gathered in my face.=
  <5D79> As we remained like that, perhaps realizing,　　perhaps not, this woman silently mended the 　　tear in my skirt.=
  <5EE9> GS_CLR=
  <5F87> There we go. It should be hidden enough now 　　so it won't stand out at least.=
  <604A> Suddenly, an indescribably pleasant         　　fragrance started tickling at my nose.=
  <6114> When I realized that the scent was drifting 　　up from the woman in front of me, my heart  　　starting racing faster yet.=
  <620B> Yes, this should do for a while at least.=
  <6333> GS_CLR=
  <63D1> ......fweh?=
  <6458> It was right where the pleats can cover it  　　up... could have been a lot worse.=
  <65A9> GS_CLR=
  <6647> Y-yes ma'am! Thank you very much! I will    　　never forget this kindness!=
  <6706> My voice turned itself inside out.=
  <6827> GS_CLR=
  <68C5> Hehehe, you really are an interesting       　　person, aren't you?=
  <6A07> GS_CLR=
  <6AA5> Aauu...=
  <6B20> I was being laughed at...=
  <6BAD> My face became hotter still.=
  <6D03> GS_CLR=
  <6DA1> Oh my. We'll need to be quick, the opening  　　ceremony will be starting soon.=
  <6EEF> GS_CLR=
  <6F8D> Eyah?! W-w, w-what should I do!?=
  <70AC> GS_CLR=
  <714A> Just relax. You can get to the auditorium   　　quicker by going through here.=
  <7297> GS_CLR=
  <7335> Yes, ma'am! Thank you very much!=
  <7419> GS_CLR=
  <74A6> I began running towards the auditorium.=
  <7541> However, I almost immediately stopped again 　　and turned back...=
  <764B> GS_CLR=
  <76E0> Ah, a moment!=
  <77EC> GS_CLR=
  <788A> Hm... yes, what is it?=
  <799F> GS_CLR=
  <7A3D> I don't even know your name...=
  <7AD7> Aah... It's Yuuna. Matsubara Yuuna.=
  <7BF9> GS_CLR=
  <7C97> Yuuna-senpai...=
  <7D1A> I murmured her name, savouring the sound.=
  <7E42> GS_CLR=
  <7EE0> Be well, Nanami-san.=
  <7FF3> GS_CLR=
  <8091> I will!=
  <810C> And that...=
  <818B> That was how「Onee-sama」and I first met.=
  <8321> GS_CUD=
  <8411> GS_CLR=
  <84A6> And that still was the only time that I had 　　been able to speak directly with her...=
  <8571> It had been exactly two months since the    　　opening ceremony.=
  <8626> This life at St. Michael's that I had so    　　long yearned for has gradually become       　　familiar to me.=
  <8709> When I first arrived, I was completely and  　　utterly bewildered.=
  <87C0> For one thing, rather than "hello" and      　　"good-bye", it's always "pleasant day to    　　you" here.=
  <889E> Junior students were expected to address    　　their seniors with deference, affixing      　　'-sama' to their names.=
  <8989> On top of that, no one runs through the     　　corridors here, and meal breaks are actually　　quiet and restful...=
  <8A71> Well, this was to be expected.=
  <8B03> I was surrounded by girls from high-class   　　families, born and bred to be proper ladies.=
  <8BD3> To a middle-class girl like myself, the     　　atmosphere here felt unusual indeed.=
  <8CEB> GS_CLR=
  <8D78> Be that as it may, after two months in this 　　environment, one does get used to it. And   　　so, now...=
  <8E5E> Myself, I shall be taking a sojourn to      　　Switzerland in August.=
  <8F20> Ah, lovely. So, that will be for the whole  　　of summer?=
  <8FD6> Yes. We summer there every year, in fact.=
  <907B> Ah, I am jealous. We, on the other hand, are　　always receiving so many guests that we are 　　not at all able to travel away from home    　　ourselves.=
  <9191> My...=
  <9212> We are always happy to receive guests, of   　　course, however when it starts becoming     　　hundreds of them at once... well, you can   　　imagine...=
  <9328> Nanami-san, will you be doing any traveling 　　over the summer?=
  <9430> GS_CLR=
  <94C5> Not really, though I will be going to visit 　　my grandmother...=
  <9582> Where is it that your grandmother lives?=
  <9672> GS_CLR=
  <9707> Well, um... in Shizuoka.=
  <979B> Aah, so she lives very nearby, then.=
  <983B> Well, I'm still jealous.=
  <991B> GS_CLR=
  <99B0> Ah, he-hehehe....=
  <9A35> Truthfully though, that was just sympathy.=
  <9ADB> By the way, have you heard what happened?=
  <9BCC> GS_CLR=
  <9C59> The usual gossiping.=
  <9CE1> Why were these "properly raised young       　　ladies" so fond of other people's business, 　　anyway?=
  <9DC4> Ah, that matter regarding Yuuna-sama, yes?=
  <9EB6> GS_CLR=
  <9F4B> Yuuna-senpai!?=
  <9FCD> Before I knew it, I had practically shouted.=
  <A06D> St. Michael's was a gathering place for     　　proper ladies of good families. Even at     　　break time, one did not raise their voice   　　like that in the middle of a classroom.=
  <A1EC> GS_CLR=
  <A281> Ah, oh my. To do such a thing... oho,       　　hohoho...=
  <A32E> A lady must keep her laughter dignified...=
  <A3CC> She also must not forget to gracefully      　　conceal her laughter with her hand.=
  <A49B> As always, whenever Yuuna-sama comes up, you　　forget yourself, yes?=
  <A5A8> GS_CLR=
  <A63D> Aauu...=
  <A6C0> But I do understand how you feel though.=
  <A764> I still can not help but be fascinated by   　　Yuuna-sama's appearance when she comes to   　　school every morning.=
  <A855> Her family has hospitals all across the     　　country, do they not?=
  <A916> Her grades are always top-notch; she        　　undoubtedly will be succeeding as the head  　　of her family's hospitals in the future, I  　　would say.=
  <AA78> GS_CLR=
  <AB0D> Yuuna-senpai, a doctor...?=
  <ABF1> GS_HI_NS=
  <AC70> Come now, Nanami-san, you need to get       　　undressed.=
  <AD26> But, but...=
  <ADAD> Now now, there's no need for you to be      　　embarrassed, is there? This is for a medical　　examination, after all.=
  <AEA0> No, but... Senpai, that's... that's...=
  <AF42> Heeheehee... Just relax now, and let me make　　you feel all better.=
  <B04A> GS_CLR=
  <B0D7> Gyah?!=
  <B151> That was dangerous. Very dangerous.=
  <B1E8> To think that a pure and proper student of  　　St. Michael's had almost fallen prey to such　　indecent fantasies.=
  <B2CF> But it seemed that whenever the subject of  　　Yuuna-senpai came up, I was apt to zone out 　　like that.=
  <B401> GS_CLR=
  <B496> So, what was that about Yuuna-senpai!?=
  <B538> Well, it is just a rumor, but... it seems   　　that Yuuna-sama shall be taking over as the 　　chairman of the Environmental Protection    　　Committee.=
  <B69A> GS_CLR=
  <B72F> The Environmental Protection Committee..... 　　What, really!?=
  <B7E1> The "Environmental Protection Committee".=
  <B87E> That was the central organization of the    　　student government at St. Michael's.=
  <B946> With all of the proper ladies of good       　　families gathered on this campus, being a   　　student representative would be a very      　　amazing thing...=
  <BA5A> ...I think.=
  <BAE1> All of the third-year student leaders will  　　be gradually retiring over the next term, as　　usual.=
  <BBC3> It seemed that there had actually been a    　　much earlier talk with the current chairman.=
  <BC9B> However, it seems that Yuuna-sama was       　　refusing to accept the position until all of　　the third-year leaders had retired.=
  <BDE6> GS_CLR=
  <BE7B> Yuuna-senpai is going to be the committee   　　chairman... how dreamy...=
  <BF38> I didn't really know why, but....=
  <BFCD> Just from the sound of those words, my body 　　had started throbbing a little.=
  <C098> And so, Yuuna-sama will be assuming office  　　at the same time that the new committee     　　members from first-year gather to...=
  <C190> Committee members?=
  <C216> Wouldn't that mean working together with    　　Yuuna-senpai?!=
  <C31C> GS_CLR=
  <C3B1> I'm going for it! The committee!=
  <C445> I gallantly thrusted my hand into the air,  　　and made my declaration.=
  <C5B2> I didn't discover until later just how      　　strict the judging for committee membership 　　really was.=
  <C691> Scholastic performance, everyday lifestyle, 　　family status...=
  <C745> Rumour had it that one's physical appearance　　and the like were critical as well.=
  <C80C> Had I known, declaring my intent like that  　　would have been completely impossible...    　　most likely, anyway.=
  <C8F4> However, in my ignorance, I was able to     　　stand firm.=
  <C9A3> And so, somehow...=
  <CA29> My rivals were pushed aside, and I found    　　myself selected for committee membership.=
  <CAF6> I might have used up my entire lifetime     　　supply of luck, but I didn't care.=
  <CBBC> Not at all, if it meant being able to work  　　together with Yuuna-senpai!=
  <CC7B> And so, bursting with joy, I had become a   　　member of the committee.=
  <CD71> GS_CUD=
  <CE49> GS_CLR=
  <CEDE> That's the last of the specifics for the    　　changes to the final club activities budget.=
  <CFAE> Yuuna-senpai, speaking before my very eyes.=
  <D055> Please see that the completed documents are 　　distributed to each of the department heads.=
  <D125> Dignified expression, tidy and pretty       　　eyebrows, lips coloured a soft pink.=
  <D1ED> Each and every part beyond beautiful.=
  <D2DA> GS_CLR=
  <D36F> Haaaa...=
  <D3EB> Together in the same room, breathing the    　　same air... Just from that, my head felt    　　like it was boiling.=
  <D527> GS_CLR=
  <D5BC> That's all for today's agenda everyone, so  　　let's conclude the meeting here.=
  <D6BB> Even so...=
  <D739> That always so beautiful, long silky hair...=
  <D7D9> Every time that Senpai moved, it flowed     　　smoothly about, swaying in the breeze.=
  <D8A3> With the setting sun shining in through the 　　window, her hair seemed to be sparkling with　　golden flecks of light.=
  <D98E> I wanted to touch it...=
  <DA19> Aah, no. There was no need for that.=
  <DAB1> Standing at Senpai's side, just breathing in　　her scent...=
  <DBB5> GS_CLR=
  <DC4A> Nanami-chan?=
  <DCCA> Ah, yes, just to have her standing before my　　eyes like that...=
  <DD87> Nanami-chan, you do realize that the meeting　　is over...?=
  <DEC1> GS_CLR=
  <DF5F> Gwyaa?!=
  <DFDA> Yuuna-senpai was right in front of me!?=
  <E100> GS_CLR=
  <E19E> Nanami-chan... Everyone else has gone home, 　　while you're sitting here lost in a daze.=
  <E2F6> GS_CLR=
  <E394> Eh...?=
  <E40E> I looked about and saw that the rest of the 　　committee members had already departed.=
  <E4D9> It appeared that Yuuna-senpai and I were the　　only ones left in the classroom.=
  <E628> GS_CLR=
  <E6C6> You mean to say that we're alone!?=
  <E764> So it would seem, yes.=
  <E7EE> Oh, fiddlesticks...=
  <E875> I had been zoning out into my wild fantasies　　once again.=
  <E924> Uuu... Yuuna-senpai had seen me acting weird　　like that...=
  <E9D4> Still, to think that now I was alone with   　　her (!) because of my doing such a thing...=
  <EB2E> GS_CLR=
  <EBCC> Nanami-chan, is something not alright?=
  <ECF1> GS_CLR=
  <ED8F> N-no, there is no problem! I'm getting      　　enough to eat, really!=
  <EED4> GS_CLR=
  <EF72> Enough... to eat...?=
  <F085> GS_CLR=
  <F123> Haa?! No, no! Nothing like that, not at all!　　There isn't anything wrong in the slightest!=
  <F1F3> Aagh... I want to die.=
  <F27D> Right in front of Senpai, I was making a    　　complete fool of myself...=
  <F3C6> GS_CLR=
  <F464>  ...hehe...=
  <F4EB> Fweh?=
  <F5EF> GS_CLR=
  <F68D> He... hahaha... hehehahahaaaa....=
  <F72A> Senpai's... laughing...=
  <F7B5> She was desperately fighting to hold back   　　her laughter.=
  <F8F1> GS_CLR=
  <F98F> Nanami-chan.... always so amusing...        　　always.. really...=
  <FA45> Before me, Yuuna-senpai was laughing hard   　　enough to bring tears to her eyes - an      　　almost unrecognizable sight.=
  <FB35> I wasn't sure if I was happy to see her like　　that or not - the feeling was complicated.=
  <FC8E> GS_CLR=
  <FD2C> A-amusing? I am?=
  <FE3B> GS_CLR=
  <FED9> Yes, very.=
  <FF57> Well, that was good, right?=
  <FFE6> She liked me a little bit, at least.=
  <1007E> Yeah, that much seemed certain.=
  <10111> It really was great to have gotten on the   　　Environmental Protection Committee.=
  <101D8> Now, I was able to actually talk with Yuuna-　　senpai once in a while.=
  <10293> And best of all, Senpai has been calling me 　　"Nanami-chan".=
  <10345> It was still usually "Nanami-san", but it   　　would turn into "Nanami-chan" unexpectedly  　　at times.=
  <104AD> GS_CLR=
  <1054B> Aah, that was funny.=
  <105D3> As her laughter settled down, Senpai dried  　　her tears with a handkerchief.=
  <1069D> Ah well, it's starting to get late. Nanami- 　　chan, would you like to head out together?=
  <107F6> GS_CLR=
  <10894> Eh...? Ah, yes!=
  <10917> Would I? Would I ever!=
  <109A1> To think that my spacing out during a       　　meeting could bring in good luck like that!=
  <10A70> Err, perhaps it wouldn't be wise to consider　　such indiscreet things...=
  <10B2D> But still! Just for today, it was alright!=
  <10BCB> After all, it meant being together with     　　Yuuna-senpai.=
  <10C84> Nanami-chan, do you have all of your things?=
  <10DAF> GS_CLR=
  <10E4D> Yes, my bag, my gym uniform... eh.., aack!?=
  <10EEC> Oh, fiddlesticks...=
  <10F73> There had been a math assignment today.=
  <1100E> Hating mathematics as much as I do, I       　　usually left my textbook at school.=
  <110D5> Seriously, why would I want to have those   　　huge obnoxious letters screaming "MATH" at  　　me all the way home?=
  <11248> GS_CLR=
  <112E6> Ah, um, I seem to have left something behind　　in class... I'll go fetch it right away!=
  <113BA> That's fine, I'll wait here for you then.=
  <114E2> GS_CLR=
  <11580> Alright!=
  <115FC> With that, I started to rush out of the     　　classroom...=
  <11737> GS_CLR=
  <117D5> Hold on, Nanami-chan!=
  <118E9> GS_CLR=
  <11987> Eh?=
  <11A89> GS_CLR=
  <11B27> That's my bag there, you know?=
  <11BC1> Haa...=
  <11C3B> Without realizing it, I had been about to   　　run off not just with my own bag, but       　　Senpai's as well.=
  <11E0B> GS_CUD=
  <11EE3> GS_CLR=
  <11F78> Uuu... Why do I keep doing stupid things    　　like that in front of Senpai...=
  <1203B> Well, no, making blunders like that was a   　　common thing for me, but...=
  <120FA> What I meant was that they seemed to happen 　　a lot more often when I was around Senpai...=
  <1221E> GS_CLR=
  <122B3> Hee... heeheehee♪ But still, because of    　　that, now I have a chance to have a nice    　　long talk with Senpai.=
  <123A5> And so today, for once, I'm thankful to be  　　like that.=
  <12453> As I walked down the corridor, my footsteps 　　started to become lighter.=
  <12565> GS_CLR=
  <125FA> Oho! This isn't a chance one often gets - I 　　wonder if I should try to give Senpai a     　　little surprise...=
  <12734> GS_CLR=
  <127C9> Knowing Senpai, she'll be passing the time  　　quietly reading, or perhaps watching the sun　　set. Surely.=
  <128B1> So, I'll just need to come up from behind   　　her and give her a shout. And then...=
  <129CE> GS_CLR=
  <12A63> She'll say something like "Kyaa, don't      　　surprise me like that, Nanami-chan!" and    　　start bapping me on the forehead...=
  <12BAE> GS_CLR=
  <12C43> And then I'd say "I'm sorry! Stop hitting   　　me! I'm sorry, I'll be good!"=
  <12D04> Gah, this was no time for wild delusions.=
  <12DA1> Senpai was waiting for me.=
  <12E83> GS_CLR=
  <12F18> Well... maybe I'll just sneak a little peek 　　in, just to see what Senpai was doing...=
  <12FE4> Crouching down, I silently opened the door.=
  <130D3> GS_CLR=
  <1319B> Where was she...?=
  <13220> I quickly glanced about the room....=
  <132C0> nn... nnn...=
  <13348> Huh? What was that?=
  <133D7> Hyaa... not good... if I don't stop...=
  <13471> Was that Senpai's voice?=
  <134FD> But, it sounded strange - pained somehow...=
  <135E3> GS_EN_NS=
  <13684> Hurry... she's coming back... hurry...      　　uhwaa...=
  <13730> S-Senpai?!=
  <137AE> Wh-what on earth was she doing?!=
  <1384A> Uhaa... her scent... uunhh...=
  <138DB> I had never before heard such sad longing in　　Senpai's voice.=
  <1398E> A voice full of desperation, and yet also   　　somehow sweet.=
  <13A40> Looking closer, I could see Senpai's white  　　fingertips twitching about between her      　　stocking-clad thighs.=
  <13B31> Senpai, is she...=
  <13BB6> ...masturbating...?=
  <13C3D> Even I knew enough about the subject to     　　realize that.=
  <13CEE> There have been, um... a few times... when I　　had found some comfort that way myself.=
  <13DC1> Haaaa......=
  <13E40> Liar. More like "constantly"...=
  <13ED3> However, this was the first time that I had 　　watched someone else.=
  <13F8C> And not just anyone... Yuuna-senpai herself.=
  <14034> Aah... ha... gyaaaa!=
  <140BC> Suddenly, I noticed what Senpai was grasping　　in her hand.=
  <14174> That's... my gym uniform.=
  <1423C> GS_EN_NS=
  <142C7> Uuuh, Nanami-chan... I love you, I love you!　　Nanami-chaaaan!=
  <14382> Wha..... me?!=
  <14446> Eeowch!?=
  <144C2> At that moment--=
  <14546> Another one of my usual blunders struck.=
  <145E2> Raising my head in astonishment, I had      　　bashed it loudly into the edge of a desk.=
  <146AF> But surely...=
  <14730> Even if I hadn't blundered, Senpai and I, we　　surely...=
  <14845> GS_CUD=
  <1491D> GS_CLR=
  <149B2> Na... Nanami-chan...=
  <14A3A> As I rubbed my head, Yuuna-senpai stared at 　　me, her face blank with shock.=
  <14AFC> My gym uniform, still grasped in her hand.=
  <14B9A> What was this... What was going on here!?!?=
