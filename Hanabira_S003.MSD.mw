  >> <07F9> We're Lovers♪=

  <08BF> GS_CUD=
  <0943> I had put my clothes back together in a bit 　　of a panic, but hopefully I had everything  　　right.=
  <0A1D> Why aren't there mirrors in the classrooms, 　　I wonder?=
  <0ACA> And of course, I would forget to bring my   　　hand mirror on a day like today...=
  <0B90> At any rate, I couldn't keep Yuuna-senpai   　　waiting any longer.=
  <0CD6> GS_CLR=
  <0D6B> S-Sorry to have kept you waiting.=
  <0E8B> GS_CLR=
  <0F29> All set?=
  <1030> GS_CLR=
  <10CE> Ah, yes.=
  <11D5> GS_CLR=
  <1273> Ah...=
  <1377> GS_CLR=
  <1415> Huh? Wh-what is it?=
  <1527> GS_CLR=
  <15C5> Hold still...=
  <1646> Yuuna-senpai suddenly reached her hand out  　　to my chest.=
  <1781> GS_CLR=
  <181F> Your ribbon is twisted.=
  <1935> GS_CLR=
  <19D3> Haa!? But I was sure that I had everything  　　just right!=
  <1A82> Gah, that was a pathetic excuse, even for   　　me...=
  <1BB6> GS_CLR=
  <1C54> Heehee, how careless of you, Nanami-chan.=
  <1D7C> GS_CLR=
  <1E1A> Aauh...=
  <1EEB> GS_HI_NS=
  <1F6A> Aah, but that kind of thing is cute too♪=
  <200F> Hwaaaa!?=
  <208B> Suddenly pounced upon, I found myself in a  　　tight hug.=
  <2141> Uwahwah, please don't do that, Senpai...=
  <21E5> Heeheehee, sow-wy☆=
  <226C> Senpai was a lot taller than I was, and so  　　when she hugged me like this, my face became　　buried in her breasts almost perfectly.=
  <236F> I c-can't breathe...=
  <23F7> Smothered in Senpai's cleavage, I wriggled  　　about, struggling for air.=
  <24BD> Aah, such unbearable cuteness, Nanami-chan!=
  <2564> Hyaaaauuuu....=
  <26DF> GS_CUD=
  <27CF> GS_CLR=
  <2864> Heehee, heeheehee♪=
  <28EB> Senpai was giggling.=
  <297B> Heehee♪ Together with Nanami-chan♪        　　Together with Nanami-chan♪=
  <2A3A> I had never seen Yuuna-senpai so wound up   　　like this before...=
  <2AF1> Things like this were changing my image of  　　her...=
  <2C26> GS_CLR=
  <2CC4> Aah... Senpai...?=
  <2D51> Yessy-yessy??=
  <2DD2> Senpai spun around to face me, a huge smile 　　across her face.=
  <2E86> Her body flowed with a dance-like elegance.=
  <2F25> Was that a result of taking ballet lessons  　　since childhood, perhaps?=
  <2FEA> Did Yuuna-senpai have this kind of          　　personality before?=
  <312C> GS_CLR=
  <31CA> Oh? Something seems strange about me?=
  <326B> No, I wouldn't say strange, but...=
  <338C> GS_CLR=
  <342A> Heehee. Silly Nanami-chan.=
  <34B8> With that, she gracefully spun about in     　　place once again.=
  <356D> Her back fully extended, her form was       　　absolutely flawless.=
  <3625> Well, not that I know anything about        　　ballet...=
  <36D2> It was, well... graceful.=
  <3767> Heehee, Nanami-chan!=
  <387A> GS_CLR=
  <3918> Ugyaa!?=
  <3993> Again, I was pounced upon.=
  <3A29> Nanami-chan, such a cutie.=
  <3B42> GS_CLR=
  <3BE0> Haauu... Senpai, you keep doing this.=
  <3C79> Once again, I found myself trapped between  　　Senpai's exceedingly well-rounded breasts,  　　wriggling and struggling.=
  <3D6E> Aaah! All snuggled up in my arms - what an  　　unbearably irresistible feeling!=
  <3E32> *rub* *rub* *grind* *grind*=
  <3EC9> Aaiiee... please, not so hard!=
  <3FE6> GS_CLR=
  <4084> And that scent...=
  <4109> Senpai nuzzled her face against my neck and 　　sniffed deeply.=
  <41C4> Aaah... so milky-sweet... Just like a baby.=
  <4263> With that, she took the opportunity to blow 　　gently into my ear.=
  <43A5> GS_CLR=
  <4443> Hyaa!?=
  <4548> GS_CLR=
  <45E6> Not to mention delightfully sensitive♪=
  <470C> GS_CLR=
  <47AA> Ooh, Senpai is a meanie!=
  <4836> The mood was a little complicated.=
  <48CC> At long last I was with Senpai, but I was   　　being treated like a child...=
  <498D> This wasn't right.=
  <4A13> I just wanted to be more--=
  <4B2C> GS_CLR=
  <4BCA> Uuuu...=
  <4CD0> GS_CLR=
  <4D6E> Eh, Senpai?=
  <4E78> GS_CLR=
  <4F16> Waaaaaah! Nanami-chan hates me!=
  <5034> GS_CLR=
  <50D2> Eh--?!=
  <51D7> GS_CLR=
  <5275> Uwaaaah... It's because I pushed you down   　　like that, isn't it??=
  <5336> Senpai, wait, what?!=
  <53C6> Caught up in the moment, touching and       　　licking your breasts, and then on to your   　　pu--=
  <54A6> Uwaahwaah!! Senpai! We are in the middle of 　　the -street-!!=
  <5558> I desperately tried to cut off the loud     　　wailing coming out of Senpai's mouth.=
  <5621> Thankfully, there didn't seem to be anyone  　　nearby...=
  <5759> GS_CLR=
  <57F7> Uh.. uuuh... hyuu...=
  <590A> GS_CLR=
  <59A8> Senpai......=
  <5A30> Nanami-chan, I suddenly get indecent with   　　you... and now you hate me?=
  <5B7A> GS_CLR=
  <5C18> T-that's not the case at all!=
  <5D34> GS_CLR=
  <5DD2> But, but - you seemed disillusioned with me 　　just now...?=
  <5F0D> GS_CLR=
  <5FAB> I wasn't! I was just a little taken aback...=
  <60D6> GS_CLR=
  <6174> But still! I was happy!=
  <628A> GS_CLR=
  <6328> Yuuna-senpai, hearing you say that you loved　　me made me feel incredibly happy!=
  <63ED> Those really were my true feelings.=
  <6484> The change in Senpai's manner did come as a 　　bit of a surprise, but it didn't change my  　　love for her.=
  <6565> Actually...=
  <65E4> Whatever happened, I was pretty sure that my　　love for Senpai only grew.=
  <672D> GS_CLR=
  <67CB> And so... when you cry, it makes me feel sad　　too... and so...=
  <687F> I... think I'm going to cry myself...=
  <696E> GS_HI_NS=
  <69ED> Nanami-chan... Nanami-chaaaan!=
  <6A87> Unya!?=
  <6B01> Yet again, I found myself pounced upon.=
  <6BA4> Nanami-chan Nanami-chan Nanami-chan Nanami- 　　chan Nanami-chaaan!!=
  <6C5C> Clinging, squeezing, rubbing, kissing here  　　and there...=
  <6D0C> Yuuna-senpai seemed to be expressing delight　　with every part of her body.=
  <6DD4> Aaa, oh my! How absolutely adorable you are,　　Nanami-chan!=
  <6E8C> That's it!! Married! Let's get married!!=
  <6F30> Married? Whaa!? That's getting carried away!=
  <6FD8> Maybe so, but let's do it anyway!=
  <7075> Senpai, get a hold of yourself!=
  <7110> And what if somebody sees us like this?!=
  <71B4> That's fine! I mean, we're lovers, aren't   　　we?=
  <7263> Eh...?=
  <72DD> Lovers?=
  <7358> Yuuna-senpai and me?=
  <73E0> We are, aren't we.=
  <7466> That is what we've become, isn't it?=
  <74FE> Yikes! I hadn't thought of it like that at  　　all before.=
  <7601> GS_CLR=
  <7696> Ah, um, Yuuna-senpai...=
  <77AC> GS_CLR=
  <784A> Hmph. That again.=
  <78D7> Ah, huh? "That"...?=
  <79E9> GS_CLR=
  <7A87> I don't like you calling me "Senpai" - it's 　　not right.=
  <7B3D> Not right..? But, you are my senpai,        　　Senpai...=
  <7C75> GS_CLR=
  <7D13> It's. Not. Right. We're lovers, you know? We　　should be calling each other something      　　special.=
  <7E7A> GS_CLR=
  <7F18> Something... special...?=
  <7FA4> Something intimate, like just "Nanami"? No  　　honourific at all?=
  <805A> ..................=
  <80E0> ............=
  <8160> ......=
  <81DA> Kyaaa-kyaaa!?=
  <825B> Even just thinking about that makes my heart　　feel like it's going to explode!!=
  <83AB> GS_CLR=
  <8449> Let's see, what would be a nice thing to    　　have you call me?=
  <8589> GS_CLR=
  <8627> Something that comes out nice and neat from 　　Nanami-chan's cute mouth...=
  <87C5> Nanami... you're so very pretty...=
  <8863> No, Senpai... this isn't the place...=
  <8904> What's wrong about it? Won't you let me hear　　you say it with that cute mouth of yours?=
  <89D9> Aaah......=
  <8B82> GS_CLR=
  <8C17> Kyaa-kyaa!! Nonononoo♪ Something like that 　　would -kill- me!♪=
  <8D58> GS_CLR=
  <8DF6> Well, Nanami-chan can stay as Nanami-chan if　　she wants. That is, unless using just your  　　given name would be okay?=
  <8F6E> GS_CLR=
  <900C> Given name only, if you please!=
  <909F> Answered without a moment's hesitation.=
  <91C5> GS_CLR=
  <9263> Really? Well then... Nanami.=
  <937E> GS_CLR=
  <941C> Hauaa!?=
  <9497> That... hit... hard...=
  <9521> Am I going to be able to endure that?=
  <9645> GS_CLR=
  <96E3> Ah, that's it, yes!=
  <97F5> GS_CLR=
  <9893> Fweh?=
  <990C> As I fidgeted by myself, Yuuna-senpai       　　suddenly struck her palm with her fist.=
  <9A62> GS_CLR=
  <9B00> Nanami-chan, starting today, I would like   　　you to call me "Onee-sama".=
  <9C4A> GS_CLR=
  <9CE8> Onee... sama...?=
  <9DF7> GS_CLR=
  <9E95> Uh huh. Perfect, isn't it?=
  <9FAE> GS_CLR=
  <A04C> Sweet little Nanami-chan calling me "Onee-  　　sama" as she snuggles against me like a     　　kitten... I can just imagine it... Aaah!!=
  <A149> Senpai's face started to glow, her body     　　twisting in place.=
  <A28A> GS_CLR=
  <A328> Well, I guess that's decided then!=
  <A449> GS_CLR=
- <A4E7> "It's decided", she says...=
  <A601> GS_CLR=
  <A69F> You... hate it?=
  <A722> A sorrowful look came over her face.=
  <A7C2> Uh...=
  <A8C6> GS_CLR=
  <A964> Nanami-chan, calling me "Onee-sama"... you  　　hate it?=
  <AA10> Senpai stared at me, her eyes brimming with 　　tears.=
  <AB5F> Ah, something else, if possible, please...=
  <AC88> GS_CLR=
  <AD26> Uwahuhuhuhu.....=
  <AE35> GS_CLR=
  <AECB> Gah?!=
  <AF44> Yuuna-senpai is crying?!=
  <AFD8> Nanami-chan's really doesn't care for me    　　after all...=
  <B090> Th-that's not true!=
  <B1A2> GS_CLR=
  <B240> Then, "Onee-sama", please?=
  <B359> GS_CLR=
  <B3F7> Th-that's...=
  <B502> GS_CLR=
  <B5A0> Uwaah! I knew it, Nanami-chan's mad at me   　　for pushing her down like that!=
  <B6EE> GS_CLR=
  <B78C> I'll do it!  I'll do it, just please stop   　　crying!=
  <B8C2> GS_CLR=
  <B960> Really?! Yaay!♪=
  <BA6F> GS_CLR=
  <BB05> Uuuh... Onee-sama, pretending to cry like   　　that is just plain mean.=
  <BBD2> Uuh... I don't hate it.=
  <BCE8> GS_CLR=
  <BD86> Really? Wonderful!=
  <BE0C> If she was going to make that kind of face, 　　how could I say no?=
  <BEC3> I was weak against Yuuna-senpai even without　　her doing that.=
  <BF7E> You mean it? You'll call me Onee-sama?=
  <C020> Yes...=
  <C09A> Utter defeat.=
  <C11B> I was no match for Onee-sama...=
  <C263> GS_CLR=
  <C301> Well then, would you say it for me right now　　please?=
  <C437> GS_CLR=
  <C4D5> Eh...?=
  <C5DA> GS_CLR=
  <C678> Uuh... you do hate it...=
  <C704> Once again, Senpai's eyes started to cloud  　　over with tears.=
  <C843> GS_CLR=
  <C8E1> Ah, um... O-, Onee-sama.=
  <C9F8> GS_CLR=
  <CA96> My....=
  <CB10> This time, in a complete change, her eyes   　　glisten and sparkle.=
  <CC53> GS_CLR=
  <CCF1> Again! Say it again!=
  <CE04> GS_CLR=
  <CEA2> Onee-sama...=
  <CFAD> GS_CLR=
  <D04B> Aaah...  such a lovely sound...=
  <D0E6> Th-this time, say "Onee-sama, pleasant day  　　to you".=
  <D21D> GS_CLR=
  <D2BB> Haaa... Onee-sama, pleasant day to you.=
  <D3E1> GS_CLR=
  <D47F> Hyaa!?=
  <D4F9> At that, Senpai - I mean, Onee-sama - bent  　　her body over backwards dramatically.=
  <D5C2> Even with her body bent back, her posture   　　didn't so much as quiver.=
  <D67F> Was that from childhood lessons in          　　traditional dance, perhaps?=
  <D746> ...Er, is that kind of pose even done in    　　traditional dance?=
  <D887> GS_CLR=
  <D925> Ooh-ooh, this time, "Onee-sama, please... be　　gentle with me."=
  <DA64> GS_CLR=
  <DB02> Onee-sama, please be gentle with me.=
  <DC25> GS_CLR=
  <DCC3> No-no-no. That's not right. It needs to have　　more... shyness to it.=
  <DE08> GS_CLR=
  <DEA6> A... Onee-sama... please, be gentle with me.=
  <DFD1> GS_CLR=
  <E06F> Kyaaaaa!?=
  <E0EC> Once again, Onee-sama's body dramatically   　　swung backwards.=
  <E1A0> I had a feeling that this had nothing to do 　　with ballet or traditional dance at all...=
  <E2F9> GS_CLR=
  <E397> Heehee, heeheehee.... Now "Yaa, no! That's  　　making me feel dirty!"=
  <E4DC> GS_CLR=
  <E57A> Yaa, no! That's making me feel... -what-?!  　　Why would I be saying that?!=
  <E642> Eheehee... I got carried away☆=
  <E760> GS_CLR=
  <E7FE> Even if you say it cutely, the answer is no!=
  <E929> GS_CLR=
  <E9C7> Ok, ok, you don't need to get so angry.     　　Nanami.=
  <EAFD> GS_CLR=
  <EB9B> Aa...=
  <EC14> Calling me just "Nanami"...=
  <ED2E> GS_CLR=
  <EDCC> What's wrong? Nanami?=
  <EEE0> GS_CLR=
  <EF7E> Eh, ah, that's...=
  <F003> Nanami...... Nanami......=
  <F11B> GS_CLR=
  <F1B9> Ooh, Nanami, you're making a strange face.=
  <F2E2> GS_CLR=
  <F380> Auauauauu...=
  <F400> Even I could tell that my face was turning  　　red.=
  <F4A8> To think that my heart would race like this 　　just from being called that...=
  <F56A> No, that's not it... it's because it's      　　coming from Onee-sama.=
  <F6AF> GS_CLR=
  <F74D> Well then, starting tomorrow, let's start   　　using these even on campus, alright?=
  <F8A0> GS_CLR=
  <F93E> Aaa... th-that's -not- a good idea!=
  <FA60> GS_CLR=
  <FAFE> I knew it... you really do hate it...=
  <FC22> GS_CLR=
  <FCC0> No, I don't - we've already been over that.=
  <FDEA> GS_CLR=
  <FE88> But that's not it. The problem is how famous　　Onee-sama is on campus.=
  <FF4B> If it got out that you were in a special    　　relationship with someone, the whole school 　　would be in an uproar.=
  <100C0> GS_CLR=
  <1015E> Me? Famous?=
  <10268> GS_CLR=
  <10306> What are you saying? Onee-sama, you're      　　beautiful, one of best students on campus - 　　not to mention the chairman of the          　　Environmental Protection Committee!=
  <104B8> GS_CLR=
  <10556> Onee-sama is the idol of all of St.         　　Michael's!=
  <10604> And now that idol has a relationship with a 　　special someone. Me.=
  <106BC> Uwaaah! When I think about it like that,    　　it's terrifying - what have I gotten myself 　　into?!=
  <10821> GS_CLR=
  <108BF> An idol...? Nanami, that's not even funny.=
  <109E8> GS_CLR=
  <10A86> Onee-sama, you can't possibly be that       　　dense...=
  <10BBD> GS_CLR=
  <10C5B> We-ell... should we keep it to ourselves for　　a while, then? It'll be a little lonely,    　　but...=
  <10DC0> GS_CLR=
  <10E5E> Yes, lets make it a secret.=
  <10F78> GS_CLR=
  <11016> Aah, that's beautiful! It's a secret then,  　　just for the two of us♪=
  <110DA> Y-yes!=
  <11154> A secret just for the two of us...=
  <111EA> Something like that could be fine indeed!=
